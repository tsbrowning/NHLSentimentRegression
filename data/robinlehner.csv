2021-12-19 23:13:41-05:00	Robin Lehner	@HulkMorgan That was for the kid I pointed too 🤦 hope he gives it back.
2021-12-19 22:05:01-05:00	Robin Lehner	https://t.co/bZySoaAzNu  what a road trip. Thanks so much @NYIslanders and all fans. I love you guys and will forever be in my heart ❤️ finally got to come back and see you guys. 🐼
2021-12-18 22:03:34-05:00	Robin Lehner	@SickNotWeak It’s not ending tho guys. Corporations and the big guys could care less. Any other subject or topic get this public attacks there would be some backing from your employers. Something from the league that it isn’t ok to discriminate. Not one word of support or action.
2021-12-18 21:06:33-05:00	Robin Lehner	@jdemers51 😂
2021-12-18 21:01:21-05:00	Robin Lehner	I’m ready for tomorrow. Yes yes yes. Lou house his rules 🤷‍♂️❤️ https://t.co/yp8Ycroehe
2021-12-18 17:48:44-05:00	Robin Lehner	Tomorrow I’ll go back to the people that accepted me for who I am and the ones that supported me no matter what. Gonna be amazing seeing you guys again. Long Island I’m forever grateful for you place in my journey. Often when I go trough these things I think of you. ❤️
2021-12-18 17:48:44-05:00	Robin Lehner	Has @nhl done anything to condemn  this or the nhlpa? I retweeted a few days ago a small taste of what’s there for me on social media. I’m not gonna stop using social media as it still helps people that deals with what I deal with. I suggest nhl stops advocating for mental health
2021-12-18 17:48:44-05:00	Robin Lehner	I have to deal with on social media from fans across the league and trough my career. Media outlets and papers that have stigmatized everything around my condition.  not just people in their moms basement. No one has a clue what’s in my dm or what I’m always tagged in.
2021-12-18 17:48:43-05:00	Robin Lehner	Being open about my bipolar was a choice to help others. To help people that struggles with mental illness to see it’s possible to be accepted.People call me sensitive and that I want attention.I wanted attention to the subject of mental health. No one have any idea of the stuff
2021-12-17 19:11:52-05:00	Robin Lehner	@Ade780 Where have we come? This progress please tell me where it is? I’m in the space and haven’t seen progress. Just fake corporations trying to make branding campaigns to better their bottom line.
2021-12-17 18:54:40-05:00	Robin Lehner	@thegravytrain33 What I did? Your coach sent them in to start this in the end of the game. 🤦 they grabbed and try to fight guys that didn’t throw their gloves. Their lucky refs were glued on me.
2021-12-17 18:51:47-05:00	Robin Lehner	@VegasMapleLeaf I’m ignoring just showing stigma is at a higher peak then ever. I see this everyday and that’s why I try to stay away from social media. But I warned them 3-4 times before I joined in. Other side sent in and was ordered to do this when 20 sec left in game. Smh
2021-12-17 18:43:31-05:00	Robin Lehner	Funny when they sent out people to go after some of my guys that didn’t wanna fight but I’m a mental case. Much love and hope in this world ❤️ stigma is getting better ehh. Progress is not being made. Time to stop acting like it. https://t.co/mQ01fTgIm5
2021-12-06 07:02:37-05:00	Robin Lehner	Took long time to make decision with my psychiatrist and family. My well being have too come first and being locked down and not knowing what happens if you test positive is to much of a risk for me. Sweden will have a great team and Markström is a beast.Hope people understand ❤️
2021-12-06 07:02:37-05:00	Robin Lehner	Great performance tonight from our team. Have to address I will not go to the olympics. I’m very disappointed and it tough decision for me as it’s once in life time opportunity. Reality is that what have been said about how it’s going to be is not ideal for my mental health.

2021-11-14 21:32:02-05:00	Robin Lehner	@SoupyOnAir @MikeMcKenna56 To be fair I burn a lot more calories then all other goalies during games.. I would suggest another commercial break for more revenue and extra rest for me.

I don’t care what they say I don’t lie about these things. 💯 true. I’ll keep going. Have stored stories for a year. Watch now when nhl will try cancel me. God luck whatever lie you

2021-10-03 02:01:58-04:00	Robin Lehner	@avjp87 No I did 8 years of team supplied ambien. Almost killed me…
2021-10-03 01:53:09-04:00	Robin Lehner	And they say ambien is sleeping pill it’s funny that rehab told me that’s why didn’t have rem sleep. 8 years no rem sleep. Great. But yeah just sleeping pills
2021-10-03 01:49:42-04:00	Robin Lehner	@DrBozz71 Yes. Many teams without prescription just hand it out

2021-10-03 01:46:40-04:00	Robin Lehner	Is it common for work places to give out benzodiazepines to employees when they travel and ambien ? Should that not be done by doctors or psychiatrist? Asking for a friend 👀 this doesn’t happen in Vegas to be clear. But I know many other teams. I also been in on teams that do?
2021-10-03 01:42:49-04:00	Robin Lehner	@gsuav1975 @WGR550 No this is our life. Be quiet if you don’t have anything god to say.

2021-10-02 18:44:17-04:00	Robin Lehner	@chrisgrutt1 @BuffaloVogl @SneakyJoeSports Called I’m Swedish. Not that good at writing.. 😂
2021-10-02 18:33:40-04:00	Robin Lehner	@JahAllen_ Nope
2021-10-02 18:30:15-04:00	Robin Lehner	@STMacP 😂
2021-10-02 18:29:57-04:00	Robin Lehner	@AlBowmansville Ahh thought so.. another tough phone guy.
2021-10-02 18:14:15-04:00	Robin Lehner	@AlBowmansville Don’t matter how big you are… pull up. You know where to find me
2021-10-02 18:12:12-04:00	Robin Lehner	@AlBowmansville Nah I’m medicated. Too bad most people don’t know what bipolar is. Love my bipolar. True gift. Sit talk in that basement. Your welcome to come say it to my face at city national arena after practice you will see me when I pull out.
2021-10-02 18:10:38-04:00	Robin Lehner	@AlBowmansville Nah gm and owners fire people. But apparently everyone is a cancer in Buffalo until they leave. 🧐
2021-10-02 18:09:46-04:00	Robin Lehner	@terryt1919 @CanuckINDallas @NHLPA We are not talking vaccine 😂 agree or disagree but I’m vaccinated…
2021-10-02 18:04:11-04:00	Robin Lehner	@AlBowmansville Ohh they will care what I have to say. Trust that.
2021-10-02 17:59:12-04:00	Robin Lehner	@RegAdamson Nah I think I’ll stay. I think I’ll keep talking as well for things to be better.
2021-10-02 17:47:20-04:00	Robin Lehner	@DOC7685 Well you don’t know all the facts unfortunately. I wish it gets better there
2021-10-02 17:45:19-04:00	Robin Lehner	@natertottt @NHLPA His work gave him the injury. So then you support corporations over the persons rights then..👌
2021-10-02 17:41:19-04:00	Robin Lehner	@ZamBonesy @NOTaBillsfan Don’t worry about them. They are hurting and I wish they get the care and help they need❤️🙏
2021-10-02 17:32:18-04:00	Robin Lehner	@MVPJA17 @thesherm87 @DolphinsZoneNFL Nope
2021-10-02 17:19:55-04:00	Robin Lehner	Your turn now.. I can keep going. You know how to reach me. 👀
2021-10-02 17:12:42-04:00	Robin Lehner	@AllThingsSabres @thesherm87 92%
2021-10-02 17:08:22-04:00	Robin Lehner	They screwed my ankle… big time. Then surgery and then pills… no care…almost died. But ehh.. after forcing leg press after few weeks after bad high ankle sprain first game. That is foot after treatment😂.. later is my soul gone after a month after surgery . It’s not all pretty https://t.co/CT8fXrp67a
2021-10-02 16:58:50-04:00	Robin Lehner	@CanuckINDallas They are watching 👀
2021-10-02 16:57:48-04:00	Robin Lehner	@gronkjr1487 92% total in Buffalo..
2021-10-02 16:46:27-04:00	Robin Lehner	@ovie08 They never sent me a jersey…
2021-10-02 16:45:39-04:00	Robin Lehner	I’m 100% an nhl fan. Love hockey and want the nhl to be great. I’m not trying to destroy anything.but do what’s right. It’s time to walk away from the old ways and in to the new. Things have to change. I talk way to much and I still have 90 % filter on. Don’t make me take it away
2021-10-02 16:36:20-04:00	Robin Lehner	@em2987 @NHLPA It involves me and should involve more players. It’s been done way to long. Also my farmer captain and a guy that’s a friend. I personally love his dad and I know they all hurting from this.
2021-10-02 16:32:26-04:00	Robin Lehner	@GabeHumbert Never while playing. I did drink to treat my self with my bipolar tho. Happy I finally got diagnosed and on medication
2021-10-02 16:31:07-04:00	Robin Lehner	Shootout I’m still working on it 😂
2021-10-02 16:30:47-04:00	Robin Lehner	@spaccapitall Very true 😂
2021-10-02 16:28:43-04:00	Robin Lehner	Sabres fans.We didn’t love each other much. was warranted against me some were not. Did my best.But I respect your passion for the franchise.This situation with your captain who was mine should be as big of a problem for you as for me. I know your hearts are in the right place 💯
2021-10-02 16:21:21-04:00	Robin Lehner	@learntomeasure @BuffaloSabres Ohh they are a business and can do whatever they want. One day in the future the uprise will come against corporations. I hope I’m alive that day.
2021-10-02 16:18:53-04:00	Robin Lehner	@BuffaloVogl ❤️ keep doing what’s right.
2021-10-02 16:14:09-04:00	Robin Lehner	@CanuckINDallas @sens303 @NHLPA Obviously we know some risk. We didn’t know before about the brain trauma risk and what it leads to. But we know we can get injured. But sure as hell hoped our employers wanted what’s best for us and not just think about the sport. We are humans too and wanna live a healthy life
2021-10-02 16:12:16-04:00	Robin Lehner	@thesherm87 @DolphinsZoneNFL If he gets injured watch them do the same to him.
2021-10-02 16:11:35-04:00	Robin Lehner	@spencer3939 The doctors work for the team and for the nhl best. Not how players are doing..  but again not that I know many players and talk and deal with players from all sports that are suffering like crazy from pain and mental illness.
2021-10-02 16:09:20-04:00	Robin Lehner	@JDrew03 @NHLPA No middle ground with a persons life with injury caused playing for an organization. Should not be any middle ground what so ever!
2021-10-02 16:06:48-04:00	Robin Lehner	@KaneRoo420 ❤️
2021-10-02 16:05:31-04:00	Robin Lehner	@MichaelEMach1 @billyStroud10 @NHLPA Everyone that gets away from there has a pretty good one again pretty fast 👀👀 facts
2021-10-02 16:04:39-04:00	Robin Lehner	@wzavatsky1313 I would if I think the league would listen. Not the case
2021-10-02 16:02:55-04:00	Robin Lehner	@JDrew03 @NHLPA Yeah void your dreams and the life of training… we all want to play and live our dreams. Does it have to be the cost of pain for the rest of our lives if the are better solutions?
2021-10-02 16:00:11-04:00	Robin Lehner	@thesherm87 https://t.co/vTcGoa4X55
2021-10-02 15:56:04-04:00	Robin Lehner	@MichaelEMach1 @ToolOf1 @NHLPA No..
2021-10-02 15:54:08-04:00	Robin Lehner	Better to have pain for the rest of their lives… At least they will supply the pain meds.. same old shit.  https://t.co/rl906Fw2UZ
2021-10-02 15:43:25-04:00	Robin Lehner	@CanuckINDallas @sens303 @NHLPA Privilege of pain for the rest of your life and no say about your own treatment…
2021-10-02 15:31:54-04:00	Robin Lehner	@albeckers @NHLPA Smh
2021-10-02 15:29:20-04:00	Robin Lehner	@philiparks @marinemom34 @MsAFromBK @SneakyJoeSports @NHLPA 🐦
2021-10-02 01:42:50-04:00	Robin Lehner	@john_wawrow @FreddyCouples @NHL @sabres There are always rules broken on both sides. 🤷‍♂️ but yeah signing a contract you are signing away your choice to pain for rest of your life possibly. Make sense
2021-10-02 00:55:49-04:00	Robin Lehner	@marinemom34 @MsAFromBK @SneakyJoeSports @NHLPA You guys don’t know anything about the behind the scenes. So no you don’t
2021-10-02 00:54:41-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Gabrielor89 @popminu @YouTube I meant it in a good way. You guys deserve better
2021-10-02 00:54:15-04:00	Robin Lehner	@sabsfankev @popminu @YouTube 😂 that’s not true
2021-10-02 00:33:17-04:00	Robin Lehner	Silence…
2021-10-02 00:32:43-04:00	Robin Lehner	@IgniteTheLamp @SameHere_Global ❤️
2021-10-02 00:29:53-04:00	Robin Lehner	@JordanGreif @NHLPA Yes about immoral shit.. yes
2021-10-02 00:28:14-04:00	Robin Lehner	Thanks for having me https://t.co/n2YNg45yPe
2021-10-02 00:24:46-04:00	Robin Lehner	@NHLPA it’s disappointing… all I got to say. Same with nhl players not sticking up for each other. Remember next time is you…
2021-10-02 00:22:33-04:00	Robin Lehner	@DS_yypo @NHL @sabres You vote for a president and agree to all he does? Can’t we fight for right or wrong anymore?
2021-10-01 22:30:30-04:00	Robin Lehner	@sirskistan2 @BuffaloSabres 👍😂
2021-10-01 22:28:01-04:00	Robin Lehner	@contribute__1 @NHL @sabres 😭

2021-10-01 22:27:29-04:00	Robin Lehner	@sirskistan2 @NHL @sabres 😂
2021-10-01 22:24:48-04:00	Robin Lehner	@popminu @YouTube They don’t deserve him wearing it. Hope fans get what they deserve there soon.
2021-10-01 22:22:56-04:00	Robin Lehner	@nhl is it good to keep a generational player out of the league? His body his choice. Do what’s right. @sabres
2021-10-01 22:22:56-04:00	Robin Lehner	Jack Eichel highlights HD https://t.co/oeAqlpwACP via @YouTube
2021-10-01 22:16:11-04:00	Robin Lehner	@MsAFromBK @SneakyJoeSports @NHLPA Yeah I’m sure he wants to get hurt permanently. How about you open your eyes. If you guys know half of how it really works in sports then open your mouth. So you don’t have eyes to open. 😂🤷‍♂️
2021-10-01 22:14:40-04:00	Robin Lehner	@tayloronethree @A2kOldHead @KariTakko @spittinchiclets @jackeichel @NHLPA Yeah miss you guys a lot tho ❤️
2021-10-01 22:10:52-04:00	Robin Lehner	@A2kOldHead @KariTakko @tayloronethree @spittinchiclets @jackeichel @NHLPA How about just do what’s right for once?
2021-10-01 22:10:19-04:00	Robin Lehner	@BillsFanatic88 @NHLPA Nhlpa is tagged in tweet.. do a rule have to be in the way of right and wrong?
2021-10-01 21:13:20-04:00	Robin Lehner	@MlKEMlKEMlKE @JamieWarren4 @JWCKota @NHLPA Nah probably just let him play on toradol for the rest of his career would be better.. 😂
2021-10-01 21:11:50-04:00	Robin Lehner	@VGKBRYAN @NHLPA I’m good
2021-10-01 21:09:27-04:00	Robin Lehner	@tadstovinsky @ChuckEGoods @OneSmugPug @NHLPA I’m having it right now.. I’m sure they are watching. Let’s have open discussion. As you see I didn’t tag the nhl.. I tagged nhlpa
2021-10-01 21:03:37-04:00	Robin Lehner	@A2kOldHead @Pellz93 @spittinchiclets @jackeichel @NHLPA 😂 you think that sports teams first priority is health for us long term? Nah it’s health now and after career bye bye 👋
2021-10-01 20:58:03-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Dcarr77 @NHLPA Not really they drafted him. They had his rights.
2021-10-01 20:57:03-04:00	Robin Lehner	@A2kOldHead @Pellz93 @spittinchiclets @jackeichel @NHLPA Again asset over health. It’s nuts.. I deal with people that don’t play anymore from many sports and other professions that gives trauma. Trust me it’s not good look for alot of them. Happy see a player think about career and life after. Kudos to jack
2021-10-01 20:55:38-04:00	Robin Lehner	@leclerks @NHLPA 😂 you probably know a lot on hiw all that works
2021-10-01 20:55:13-04:00	Robin Lehner	@sigshiesty @A2kOldHead @spittinchiclets @jackeichel I am taking it up with the nhlpa right now.. be nice if they answered to the tweet. 👀👀
2021-10-01 20:54:37-04:00	Robin Lehner	@ChuckEGoods @OneSmugPug @NHLPA No if it was he be playing now. He got injury while playing there… now he wants to do what he feels best for his body. Here is what you guys don’t know. Team say what’s best for playing now and hurt after career. He might want best now and not pain in neck everyday after career
2021-10-01 20:52:46-04:00	Robin Lehner	@CanuckINDallas @NHLPA It sure can. Still we have the freedom to make those choices..
2021-10-01 20:52:20-04:00	Robin Lehner	@_PapaBear @spittinchiclets @jackeichel Did he get the injury while playing for the Sabres ? His body his choice period.
2021-10-01 20:50:47-04:00	Robin Lehner	@OneSmugPug @NHLPA So money over body then… 🤮I’m a bit biased as I’ve seen the stuff over there. Have some say 😂 now that’s funny statement.
2021-10-01 20:39:08-04:00	Robin Lehner	@A2kOldHead @spittinchiclets @jackeichel His body his choice
2021-10-01 20:37:38-04:00	Robin Lehner	Where is the @nhlpa and all nhl players in all this attacks on our freedom of choice? Jack situation is crazy to me.. also people getting attacked by journalist that hides behind freedom of speech to trash peoples freedom of choice. When does the hypocrisy end? #lifeaftercareer
2021-10-01 20:32:44-04:00	Robin Lehner	@A2kOldHead @spittinchiclets @jackeichel Nah. His body his choice. We have a life after our careers too. Funny that fighters have done that procedure many times successfully. But ehh they just gets punched and kicked in the head for a living 👀👀🤷‍♂️

2021-09-24 22:04:37-04:00	Robin Lehner	@RidingThePine21 @JesseGranger_ A few
2021-09-24 21:57:18-04:00	Robin Lehner	@AllHailKingBerg @ASPCA @MStoner61 Calm down I was just looking around in the desert if I found any. That they went in his pool maybe they needed to cool of ? 🤷‍♂️😂 didn’t destroy or do anything wrong with them.
2021-09-24 21:46:43-04:00	Robin Lehner	@JesseGranger_ Ryan reaves is scared of snakes so I tried to get one for him 🤷‍♂️

2021-09-23 22:41:32-04:00	Robin Lehner	@TimCPeel20 @walsha @GoldenKnights Best ref in the league. Miss you brother
2021-09-23 22:40:51-04:00	Robin Lehner	@tfun_mb_SUB2 Nah he went out as a legend

2021-09-23 04:36:41-04:00	Robin Lehner	@TimCPeel20 @walsha Same too you my friend. My favorite ref in the league. 🙏
2021-09-23 04:27:43-04:00	Robin Lehner	@IslesGirl3 His house his rules 🤷‍♂️
2021-09-23 04:25:09-04:00	Robin Lehner	@IslesGirl3 I’ll shave for that game I promise ❤️

2021-09-23 03:42:08-04:00	Robin Lehner	@GoldenKnights he wasn’t “people” it was my wife 😂
2021-09-23 02:52:00-04:00	Robin Lehner	@MikeMcKenna56 👀 great goalie tho. I’m a big fan.
2021-09-20 22:09:54-04:00	Robin Lehner	@MarioLarouche @DLCoulisses That just don’t support my statistics. So that’s completely wrong and can’t be argued.
2021-09-20 18:47:24-04:00	Robin Lehner	@MarioLarouche @DLCoulisses Absolutely I do. Not the point. Not arguing I don’t have a great life and I’m blessed. Simply saying from a hockey perspective that I’ve been punished since coming out about issues a lot of people deal with.
2021-09-16 16:08:49-04:00	Robin Lehner	@edithgarcia0305 @bigwoodmma 😂

2021-08-12 22:37:03-04:00	Robin Lehner	@twelcher15 Won’t be me… I out weigh him 2/1 and I like him. But someone will 😂
2021-08-12 22:34:41-04:00	Robin Lehner	@twelcher15 Great goalie that will get his ass kicked soon 😂
2021-08-12 21:15:04-04:00	Robin Lehner	@AaronBe86729084 Martin, Roy, flower
2021-08-12 21:09:18-04:00	Robin Lehner	@caselud204 Make so much sense. Again you are just useless when it comes to stats and what other player have gotten while having hip surgery. I had a mental health illness treated with meds and I got fucked.
2021-08-12 21:07:12-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Challe013 I can’t talk in Sweden. That not allowed. I’m sweden everyone need to be silent and can’t be any different from each other. Not the Swedish way
2021-08-12 21:05:03-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Nick_Is_A_Bot Good goalie. Gets lot of shots but should not have won Vezina over  vasy.
2021-08-12 21:01:32-04:00	Robin Lehner	@caselud204 I don’t have to explain it. Do some research and you will figure it out…👍😴
2021-08-12 20:58:40-04:00	Robin Lehner	@PrimeBane Not really

2021-08-12 20:54:43-04:00	Robin Lehner	@schmidty999 Well that game would have been the same no matter what goalie played it. 👍👍
2021-08-12 20:53:57-04:00	Robin Lehner	@theodore_stan Vasy, rask,Peterson, Gibson, sorokin. Flower.
2021-08-12 20:47:05-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Erikkef Ask Buffalo fans.. they think they are the same as shootouts. But I would say carter maybe.

2021-08-12 20:35:21-04:00	Robin Lehner	@HockeyIQ716 Incredible talent. One of the best players I’ve played with. Back i. The day I took time to get in to a team. These days they just hand out captain to teenagers.. don’t work.
2021-08-12 20:31:24-04:00	Robin Lehner	@TheReplayGuy The animals loves 🐼  😂

2021-08-12 17:21:31-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Westy1112 Keep finding new meds brother
2021-08-12 17:20:58-04:00	Robin Lehner	@PagliaroliBruno Good. Great goalie with another example of old school coach making it more difficult for a young player to perform
2021-08-12 17:20:17-04:00	Robin Lehner	@JJNelson2105 Great
2021-08-12 17:20:01-04:00	Robin Lehner	@mattymo3061 Not harder then other places

2021-08-12 17:13:12-04:00	Robin Lehner	@sens_fan555 I can’t say Vegas yet as I’m playing there but former teams 1. Nyi 2.Chicago 3. Ottawa. 4. Buffalo
2021-08-12 17:11:51-04:00	Robin Lehner	@agovoni2118 @NationwideArena Be pretty cool if it was an actual bullet In there 😂
2021-08-12 17:11:18-04:00	Robin Lehner	@SameHere_Global Depends on the day. Some times I don’t eat some times I do then it’s spaghetti with meat sauce and Alfredo mixed and cheese.
2021-08-12 17:10:28-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Lorenzovald_ I sit by my self. Big guy needs his space
2021-08-12 17:10:04-04:00	Robin Lehner	@vegexo Well they don’t like it and they know I don’t care that they don’t like it.

2021-08-12 17:08:06-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Veaner85 They are really ugly
2021-08-12 17:07:14-04:00	Robin Lehner	@bgiannascoli There were so many great ones. I always beat them in Chinese poker too
2021-08-12 17:06:24-04:00	Robin Lehner	@kevin3841 @J_Habs @tyjayphilly No but they should
2021-08-12 17:05:59-04:00	Robin Lehner	@McguirePetrov He always winks at me. I get flattered every time 😂 🥰
2021-08-12 17:05:07-04:00	Robin Lehner	@JustinRagusa @NHL Idk they don’t really like to talk about that stuff
2021-08-12 17:04:36-04:00	Robin Lehner	@mercerart Xbox obviously
2021-08-12 17:04:18-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Petruic11 Hmm Vegas 😂
2021-08-12 17:04:01-04:00	Robin Lehner	@JeremyTiermini Man we win the cup first year. But can’t tell you my secret 😂
2021-08-12 17:03:12-04:00	Robin Lehner	@colegoalfield Great goalie but seems to be a better person. Not easy to be goalie in Canadian market. But vasy is the best.
2021-08-12 17:02:08-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Jesse_Habs Yes I remember he scored one and I saved a few more from him. Unfortunately not enough.
2021-08-12 17:00:57-04:00	Robin Lehner	@m_marsell Panda goalie
2021-08-12 17:00:35-04:00	Robin Lehner	@PhilippePhilope Aik 😂

2021-08-12 16:58:00-04:00	Robin Lehner	@RinkRatBQ Yeah he might kill me… would not want to face him in a game.
2021-08-12 16:57:34-04:00	Robin Lehner	@NHLJackManning That they know anything about me…
2021-08-12 16:56:30-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Fixie_Mike1125 @jrod2589 PSG 😂

2021-08-12 16:55:26-04:00	Robin Lehner	@elgrondinos Buffalo.. Edmonton and Winnipeg I believe. This is not mine but mostly what I hear from people.
2021-08-12 16:53:49-04:00	Robin Lehner	@BryanWilley78 Battling them. Only hard part about admitting it was being punished by it and people that don’t know saying ignorant things
2021-08-12 16:52:59-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Mountie_The Hopefully to surgery to get his neck fixed
2021-08-12 16:52:38-04:00	Robin Lehner	@tyjayphilly I sit on my phone and chill. Do some Pre scout. Especially on Caufield 😂

2021-08-12 16:49:21-04:00	Robin Lehner	@MarcMethot3 I loved how your frustrated face you always made. 😂
2021-08-12 16:48:16-04:00	Robin Lehner	@therealdjmach Yeah it was. But that didn’t have anything to do with the people of Buffalo
2021-08-12 16:47:49-04:00	Robin Lehner	@jbrssll Pub 189 and a lot of my friends I met in Buffalo.
2021-08-12 16:47:11-04:00	Robin Lehner	@bres39 No

2021-08-12 16:46:11-04:00	Robin Lehner	@DiPietrosGhost There are so many. But they are not superstitions it’s called ocd..
2021-08-12 16:45:39-04:00	Robin Lehner	@sligara Yeah I heard you. I prayed to God that you were gonna get the help you needed the whole game. That’s why I didn’t look 😂
2021-08-12 16:44:54-04:00	Robin Lehner	@dannyyhiggs Peaky blinders

2021-08-12 16:38:27-04:00	Robin Lehner	@PtakAttack30 Hmm… I wanted to make pads  this year with the famous Allan Walsh swords but didn’t get that ok:)
2021-08-12 16:37:26-04:00	Robin Lehner	@IfWinterComes Really hard to do with hockey in my belief
2021-08-12 16:36:47-04:00	Robin Lehner	@ambiguoususers People just are not educated about mental health. I believe that people educated in it even aren’t as they learned from books directed from the government for profits and pharma.
2021-08-12 16:35:03-04:00	Robin Lehner	@howey_feelin Yes
2021-08-12 16:34:55-04:00	Robin Lehner	@randytoleafs No

2021-08-12 16:32:41-04:00	Robin Lehner	@StarkyCPM Some but not many
2021-08-12 16:32:25-04:00	Robin Lehner	@CareephuL Not much to say. I’m gonna miss him.
2021-08-12 16:31:50-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Dhenn88 I’ve had a lot. Stone is a great person.
2021-08-12 16:31:09-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Crispens87 His happy presence
2021-08-12 16:30:35-04:00	Robin Lehner	@XtheXlanternX Yeah I use old equipment usually. So the puck tend to hurt a lot

2021-08-12 16:27:20-04:00	Robin Lehner	@PriceXNHL Kipper in Calgary
2021-08-12 16:26:40-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Airsuzuki I got along with him. I liked him as a person and friend for those years but again we didn’t hang out that much.
2021-08-12 16:25:43-04:00	Robin Lehner	@kawaiittrash No I was relieved and felt really good about it. Explained a lot
2021-08-12 16:25:12-04:00	Robin Lehner	@babybergy37_ Idk to be honest.
2021-08-12 16:24:50-04:00	Robin Lehner	@JoshZamboniGuy Don’t really think about them
2021-08-12 16:24:32-04:00	Robin Lehner	@HockeyNyi I have a lot of meaningful and bad ones 😂
2021-08-12 16:24:11-04:00	Robin Lehner	@hey_itsjayme The way they love flowers 😂

2021-08-12 16:21:32-04:00	Robin Lehner	@HockeyNyi The people and the fans
2021-08-12 16:21:20-04:00	Robin Lehner	@AdamSalim1910 Vasy hands down.
2021-08-12 16:21:06-04:00	Robin Lehner	@ExpressiveStone Nah I don’t play. Sorry
2021-08-12 16:20:53-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Waynelambert123 @GojiraMusic No. I’ll look them up
2021-08-12 16:20:35-04:00	Robin Lehner	@theKING_II Really not vegan.. 🤷‍♂️
2021-08-12 16:20:11-04:00	Robin Lehner	@VGKborn199500 Really good. Hope yours as well.
2021-08-12 16:19:31-04:00	Robin Lehner	How about a q/a ? I got some time. Bad or good question. Friendly or hostile I’m up for it. @ me and I’ll see how honest I can be.
2021-08-12 16:16:40-04:00	Robin Lehner	@dismalmemoir Has nothing to do with my point. 😂
2021-08-12 16:11:04-04:00	Robin Lehner	@randytoleafs @Brodycampbell30 Wish they sent me a jersey..
2021-08-12 15:59:01-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Brodycampbell30 You must have made a mistake… how can this overweight panda do that? Can’t be true 🤥😎🧐
2021-08-12 15:45:12-04:00	Robin Lehner	@BillsMafiaEP @paulynuch @LLysowski @camandstrickpod Made some of my best friends in my life in Buffalo. Great people in that town. Just the vibe in that arena was very hard to get going in at the end. Was constant change and we had the wrong people there including me.
2021-08-12 15:41:44-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Mark_inFairport @paulynuch @LLysowski @camandstrickpod Above my knowledge.. not many people listens. That includes the nhlpa.
2021-08-12 15:40:15-04:00	Robin Lehner	@paulynuch @LLysowski @camandstrickpod I do as well. As I said very disappointed that I could not help more. Fans are very passionate but also right now very angry. Totally understand that and they deserve better. Highest payed cap hit on that team should be the social media person..that not an easy job 😂
2021-08-12 15:35:26-04:00	Robin Lehner	@paulynuch @LLysowski @camandstrickpod Yeah I went trough medical horror there and hope he gets to do what he wants with his body and career. He is one of the best players in the league. Get the young man the help he wants already. Body and mind bigger then hockey.
2021-08-12 15:29:43-04:00	Robin Lehner	@paulynuch @LLysowski @camandstrickpod No about my time there.. not the staff. All those people that was there then aren’t there anymore I believe.
2021-08-12 15:28:59-04:00	Robin Lehner	@swcondon @LLysowski @camandstrickpod If God wants that then yes. But to try to shine light on something so common like mental health being so hard to do makes me wonder if it make sense anymore. Most charities are backed by pharma..
2021-08-12 15:26:10-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Anthony29078425 I had a panic attack during my last season with them and then I went to rehab. Many things lead to that mostly my own. But concussions and surgery in a few years were not easy. I have pics what the pain killers did to me as well. I’m just happy I’m good now.
2021-08-12 15:20:44-04:00	Robin Lehner	@paulynuch @LLysowski @camandstrickpod I was interviewed and I said what happened.. pretty simple.
2021-08-12 15:15:49-04:00	Robin Lehner	@swcondon @LLysowski @camandstrickpod The path I’m on have no map.
2021-08-12 14:55:31-04:00	Robin Lehner	@LLysowski @camandstrickpod 300 pound leg press weeks after you have high ankle sprain and tore a bunch more was the cause of the surgery.. I listened to the people there. facts.. my other issues my own fault. Pic same day as the leg press.. Sabres fans keep say I blame others.. 😂 https://t.co/inJmTOmc6J
2021-08-12 01:29:00-04:00	Robin Lehner	@JaredOMFG Not fighting 😂 if we were fighting you would feel it. But the 3 people that follow you can Chat with you about this tomorrow.
2021-08-12 01:18:02-04:00	Robin Lehner	@JaredOMFG your 3 followers as well
2021-08-12 00:20:41-04:00	Robin Lehner	@MatchuPichuKing They can have it. Need more then me
2021-08-12 00:08:47-04:00	Robin Lehner	@CamJanssen25 @Jayyy9196 🤥 😂
2021-08-11 23:56:22-04:00	Robin Lehner	#bronson #5th personality 😂 the old days. Social media please help me bring it back. For the cup 😎 time for the old guy to come back. See you when season starts. Social media clowns keep coming. 😍 https://t.co/5nqCgsgrvL
2021-08-11 23:33:13-04:00	Robin Lehner	@curriehabs 😂 no there was no gun to my head but it was the only thing there was. The offered me 4 years and I said no only because I wanted mh people feel like there is a possibility to get long term trust
2021-08-11 23:31:24-04:00	Robin Lehner	@WashedUpTendy I know Thailand bro 😂
2021-08-11 21:09:05-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Higgzins Loved the people. One of my biggest regrets in my life was that I could not get the help needed faster and be a part of the solution there. I wish Sabres the best. Just depressing playing there with so many years of loosing and I understand the pain of the fans.
2021-08-11 21:06:45-04:00	Robin Lehner	@vjbrown89 Loved the people I believe I said and that all the years loosing there created a depressing environment. Prove me wrong..
2021-08-11 20:55:20-04:00	Robin Lehner	@bogertKisch It will have its own chapter if I find a good ghostwriter for a book.
2021-08-11 20:52:47-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Higgzins Nah I answered a question. I have all the proof and big surgery that led to other issues. I’ve said my peace about jack. He should be able to do what he wants with his body.
2021-08-11 20:02:15-04:00	Robin Lehner	Man there was a lot of people crazier then my 5th personality in Amsterdam. Who knew 😂
2021-08-11 19:44:47-04:00	Robin Lehner	@vids_nhl Then you totally misunderstood what I say. The actual money as I said in the tweet is not what I’m complaining about. It’s about people being treated fairly to what your statistics are. I wasn’t. Was hoping to get fair value so I wanted to show people with mh issues you can do it
2021-08-11 19:39:57-04:00	Robin Lehner	@michael_b1984 The conditions I’ve played with trough my whole life is nothing compared to what you clowns think of me. I have nothing to prove. I’ve proved it many times. I’m just here to do my best to give the team a chance to win. What you think means nothing👋
2021-08-11 19:31:56-04:00	Robin Lehner	@johanpreuss It is essential. You don’t know what I’m doing here.
2021-08-11 18:21:49-04:00	Robin Lehner	@johanpreuss Have you forgot that there is a life to live?
2021-08-11 18:14:41-04:00	Robin Lehner	@michael_b1984 What?
2021-08-11 16:51:11-04:00	Robin Lehner	@VgkDean Was so great. The people are so nice.
2021-08-11 16:48:00-04:00	Robin Lehner	While everyone keep hating each other on social media. I visit the bazaar in Casablanca and hang with the people of Morocco. Cleaning my soul around positive people. What a day. Show respect and get respect. 🙏❤️ https://t.co/fRboAG920h
2021-08-11 13:49:08-04:00	Robin Lehner	@NelsonDola69 I know that. That’s why the program hides everyone that’s in it.
2021-08-10 21:29:13-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Habscentral This year yeah.
2021-08-10 21:22:58-04:00	Robin Lehner	@JimmyDunphy1 Ullmark got same money as me and what was his stats and how many times was he injured and had hip surgery?
2021-08-10 21:19:38-04:00	Robin Lehner	@oenophil15 No. I signed as the starting goalie for Vegas in the playoffs in the bubble. But we can mix facts if you want.
2021-08-10 21:17:18-04:00	Robin Lehner	@SINKIDCITY Yeah not many people currently playing in sports honest about it and I tell them to be quiet about it as well. Not easy to deal with you clowns.
2021-08-10 21:16:10-04:00	Robin Lehner	@devinaxdunlap @spaccapitall I turned down the extension in nyi out of principle for waiting a summer for a offer and I had one day to decide in theirs.  Chicago decided to tank and traded me.
2021-08-10 21:07:03-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Bozzyy_ @boeser6141 Ohh some common sense. Chicago was awesome and we scored goals but I averaged the most shots. Enough defending. There is no other purpose to me telling truth then to help change the awful discrimination of mental health issues that so many in sports and world have.
2021-08-10 21:02:13-04:00	Robin Lehner	@spaccapitall Then you don’t know much about statistic.
2021-08-10 20:58:47-04:00	Robin Lehner	#facts #businessleverage #howtheworldworks
2021-08-10 20:58:47-04:00	Robin Lehner	People who think that in my latest podcast was complaining about my salary for the reason of actual money are Crazier then my 5th personality on a bender in Amsterdam. It’s about that I have better stats then most and get paid less becuse I’m open about mental health issues.
2021-08-01 21:16:56-04:00	Robin Lehner	@carolh313 @MikeyBoyCanada Naturally idc.. I said if he is in the wrong I’ll stand on her side. Would like to see both sides before attacking people. Cancel culture at its finest.
2021-08-01 21:10:43-04:00	Robin Lehner	@carolh313 @MikeyBoyCanada I did it because the public is attacking him before evidence.
2021-08-01 21:07:47-04:00	Robin Lehner	@kristinophotos Well if you think the police have a good system on what’s mentally ill you in for a big one. They hide their problems as well becuse they don’t wanna be punished. If you can do harm to another human being it’s obviously something wrong.
2021-08-01 21:00:59-04:00	Robin Lehner	@carolh313 @MikeyBoyCanada Who are you to tell me my boundaries? Do you know any of the people you comment on behind that screen?
2021-08-01 20:40:57-04:00	Robin Lehner	@bbudzinski @JoanneK16 @MauriceBenard @mbstateofmind North America
2021-08-01 20:40:39-04:00	Robin Lehner	@bbudzinski @JoanneK16 @MauriceBenard @mbstateofmind 😂 2 players… ocd, adhd, anxiety and depression/ addiction you name it I’ve seen in every team I’ve been on in my 12 years since coming to both America. People just can show it or they be punished.
2021-08-01 20:36:40-04:00	Robin Lehner	@fleets93 Most people struggle with something and that’s the stigma. Government make you hide it or you get punished. Same for many jobs like cops, military doctors etc… they can’t have any trauma for what they been trough or they might loose their job.
2021-08-01 20:34:48-04:00	Robin Lehner	Mentally ill
2021-08-01 20:34:17-04:00	Robin Lehner	@kristinophotos Yeah your clearly well balanced in your head if you can abuse people. 👍
2021-08-01 20:32:49-04:00	Robin Lehner	To open up. I wanted to live in the USA for my life but the usa don’t let “mentality I’ll” people get green cards. I could have been quiet and not said anything. But the help for people that are and have gone trough same as me is worth the punishment. Same with insurance etc.. ✌️
2021-08-01 20:32:48-04:00	Robin Lehner	I’ll shut down the tweets for a bit to focus on some of my things I’m doing. Biggest take for any ignorant fool out there. If you think I’m on social media and do what I do for my benefit.. give your head a shake or to make it about me. I’ve lost a lot of money and opportunity
2021-08-01 20:22:36-04:00	Robin Lehner	@TylerTommkoo @evanderkane_9 If you read between the lines on my tweet you see I point at that as well.
2021-08-01 20:20:57-04:00	Robin Lehner	@kristinophotos Never said that and should not have consequences but they are the main reason for abuse. To bad we can’t get the education we need to understand that. Someone that has been trough trauma is a lot more likely to give it.
2021-08-01 19:16:22-04:00	Robin Lehner	@secretlifecfme It’s in my article in the athletic. Mentally while I was suffering and neglecting them. There is different types of abuse. My mental illness made my family suffer. Saddest thing I had to come to terms with. Wasn’t there as a husband and a father.
2021-08-01 18:59:04-04:00	Robin Lehner	@rwcaps @SubduedTheatrix You know nothing about me. I will not be like all the other celebrity/ athletes and say what I say for my image just to make money. I’ve seen shit and done shit in my life I regret. Only reason I speak out is to help people because it certainly don’t help me.
2021-08-01 18:24:10-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Ligma_MyBalls @evanderkane_9 Well not saying what you gone trough. You don’t know mine but you clearly don’t understand the different illnesses.
2021-08-01 17:56:09-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Ligma_MyBalls @evanderkane_9 Again you just haven’t seen or know what your talking about. I have and work with many groups who have.
2021-08-01 17:54:43-04:00	Robin Lehner	@MGeschwind @arjill014 Nothing needed to clarify for me we can all have different opinions. I don’t know what you have gone trough and you don’t know what I’ve been trough and seen. All I’m saying there are two sides to everything. Don’t judge until we know for sure. It’s ok to disagree.
2021-08-01 17:02:09-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Neilskies Gambling is a real issue and can take over someone’s life as much as addiction to any substance. Addiction and mental illness lives together in some  shape or form. Again not hiding behind it. Let’s wait and see the facts before judging like all social media trolls always do.
2021-08-01 16:56:19-04:00	Robin Lehner	@h_ebert @samanthacp_ Of course that’s not what I’m saying and if true it’s not ok.Just say addicts and mental illness does that to many people and should have real help. But again can everyone wait with judgement until facts are out there.
2021-08-01 16:43:53-04:00	Robin Lehner	@icehockeystick Also the allegations was him not being around the family and neglecting them. I put the comparison I did my family the same until I got help.
2021-08-01 16:42:46-04:00	Robin Lehner	@icehockeystick Well I’ve seen many forms of it in my own life so didn’t mean it as to belittle actual domestic violence. But for close ones to live with someone with untreated illnesses can be extremely tough if they love them. Day in and out for years.
2021-08-01 16:39:57-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Ligma_MyBalls @evanderkane_9 This is why society is screwed up.. no understanding and education about what mental illness / addiction is. You have to suffer the consequences of your action even with illness but a bit of education about it people might not kill them self as much as they do… and take drugs..
2021-08-01 16:35:39-04:00	Robin Lehner	@icehockeystick No of course not. If you ever read my article in athletic I say that becuse of how I dealt with my mental illness by being in a room all day long isolating and drinking while not taking care of my family was a mental torture on my family as well while not being good dad/ father.
2021-08-01 14:02:26-04:00	Robin Lehner	@MGeschwind @amarino0910 I did and will praise it again how hard and strong it is to perform on the highest level in sports under the scrutiny he has last season. Very hard to do. I haven’t defended anything else as I have no facts and knowledge about what your talking about.
2021-08-01 13:52:47-04:00	Robin Lehner	@isabelschmtzlr @evanderkane_9 I never said anyone was innocent. we should not jump to conclusions before the facts from both sides. While dealing with issues you can get help and move forward and be better or not. It’s not hiding from what you have done.
2021-08-01 13:44:41-04:00	Robin Lehner	@MGeschwind Well I believe in innocent until proven guilty. If you don’t then that’s your opinion.
2021-08-01 13:35:12-04:00	Robin Lehner	@MGeschwind I’m not I’m saying that. let’s get the facts then judge. I said I’ve been around him a lot and never seen gambling on hockey. I’m not saying know one is lying as well. I just said being ill like i was and was tough for my family received a lot different attention.
2021-08-01 13:17:23-04:00	Robin Lehner	Why did people understand how I was a terrible dad and husband while dealing with my health and people attack him for dealing with issues…  That’s the question and I wonder why… I hope this gets cleared up as soon as possible for all involved. ❤️🙏
2021-08-01 13:17:23-04:00	Robin Lehner	Hope with love and support evander will keep working on the problems regarding addiction to gambling witch he has said he is. I hope the best for the whole family. But him being attacked as a father and person is not fair and frankly non of anyone’s business.
2021-08-01 13:17:23-04:00	Robin Lehner	This all got investigated very fast while other matters haven’t.. I can tell you from my experience that I’ve been around and got to know evander. We will se what the investigation says but from my experience he has never gambled on hockey and I hope that’s the case.
2021-08-01 13:17:22-04:00	Robin Lehner	Put my family trough a very hard time while not knowing being bipolar and treated it my way. Yet everyone was supportive. Gambling is a huge addiction and mental health problem as well and yet no support. It’s more proof that we all get treated different.
2021-08-01 13:17:22-04:00	Robin Lehner	I can’t say for a fact as I don’t have them as well. But for everyone to attack him without knowing the truth is not fair and not the American way. Last thing for me is I wrote in my article how my mental illness put more suffering on my wife and kids then some domestic violence
2021-08-01 13:17:21-04:00	Robin Lehner	When coming to marriage and divorces etc.. non of us knows what is going on yet we jump to conclusions while hearing from one side. I’ve been around evander while gambling many times and never once has there been any hockey involved.
2021-08-01 13:17:21-04:00	Robin Lehner	I played with Evander and I’ve seen faults like I had as well and how he has handled him self in public eye this year while dealing with it all has been something I understand how hard it’s been for him and take strength
2021-08-01 13:17:21-04:00	Robin Lehner	It’s funny how everything has become guilty until proven innocent and only listen to one side. We gone really fast trough something really hard for a human being to judge once again. I don’t know the facts and we will find out in due time. @evanderkane_9
2021-08-01 11:04:44-04:00	Robin Lehner	🙏 https://t.co/UZiQgBdKc8
2021-07-31 21:50:30-04:00	Robin Lehner	@GeoffFrck @GoldenEdgeRJ @walsha It’s his agent witch I respect but lots of people I’ve played with including me that has happened to. Look at legends in all other sports not getting the loyalty they they deserve..it’s a business always been and will be.
2021-07-31 21:16:18-04:00	Robin Lehner	@GeoffFrck @GoldenEdgeRJ Same has and will happen to me again and many more that I know in the league I’ve played in for a long time. Most people find out in Twitter and sport center..
2021-07-31 21:09:48-04:00	Robin Lehner	@GeoffFrck @GoldenEdgeRJ It’s very normal actually…
2021-07-31 21:01:25-04:00	Robin Lehner	@GeoffFrck @GoldenEdgeRJ What have I said that tout my self ? When are we gonna learn there is no loyalty in sports? How was Lundqvist treated in nyr last season? I found out in Twitter that I was traded from Chicago. Again let’s not act like this is not a normal thing. All pro sports in America..👎😡
2021-07-31 20:50:00-04:00	Robin Lehner	@GeoffFrck @GoldenEdgeRJ Matt has 2 rings so I don’t know if this is meant as a compliment or not 🧐 but will I ever be as accomplished as Flower .. absolutely not. HOF 1 ballot all the way.
2021-07-31 20:34:11-04:00	Robin Lehner	@GoldenEdgeRJ I have no one else’s shoes to fill but my own.

2021-07-29 02:05:04-04:00	Robin Lehner	@MarshaMcDevitt1 Don’t be ashamed I have to kids and amazing wife and I thought the same. Seek help and you can overcome it. Don’t stop believing that things will be good.
2021-07-29 02:01:46-04:00	Robin Lehner	@julianne_pens @KevinTCottrell @Simone_Biles @naomiosaka I actually did it to him once 😂
2021-07-29 01:27:41-04:00	Robin Lehner	@KevinTCottrell @Simone_Biles @naomiosaka Well you can do that shit to me but yo say that to Toews that has led his team to 3 cups I think your wrong 😂
2021-07-29 00:46:10-04:00	Robin Lehner	@KevinTCottrell @Simone_Biles @naomiosaka Yeah the tough quiet ones just end up taking their lives… probably a better solution. I held in my struggles for most of my life. becoming soft have saved my life. But yeah put the barrel to my forehead and see if I flinch.
2021-07-28 19:40:23-04:00	Robin Lehner	@lordtomsaran @piersmorgan Yeah it’s the Swedish in me 😂

2021-07-28 15:04:40-04:00	Robin Lehner	@nick_dece We have our down periods and that don’t mean loosing. Keep moving forward and seek for more help to get trough it. 🙏❤️

2021-07-28 14:48:59-04:00	Robin Lehner	@BillJenkins43 Yes they will. Happened to me before and many others. Unfortunately how this business works in many cases.
2021-07-28 14:41:23-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Taxpro4gamblers It is for me too I can assure you
2021-07-28 14:31:16-04:00	Robin Lehner	@johnmoe Thank you 🙏 ❤️
2021-07-28 14:30:30-04:00	Robin Lehner	@grittystwin @az_watz No. I think calling the issues that exist what they are and not come up with that is a sport related issue. Athletes are humans like everyone so why should we have different labels for the mental problems.
2021-07-28 14:28:51-04:00	Robin Lehner	@TheMagnetMan4 That is correct and sure is a big problem.
2021-07-28 14:27:59-04:00	Robin Lehner	Together we will make the change https://t.co/Mw4sOz44WS
2021-07-28 14:26:27-04:00	Robin Lehner	@az_watz Yeah there is a lot of anxiety in sports except that sport teams labels it as being nervous and can’t handle the pressure while you can help them with that anxiety and get out the true potential of the player. It’s sad.
2021-07-28 14:22:14-04:00	Robin Lehner	@heylandsberg 🙏❤️ Sicknotweak thanks my friend
2021-07-28 14:17:46-04:00	Robin Lehner	@TheMagnetMan4 That’s the dumbest thing I’ve heard in awhile.

2021-07-28 10:58:22-04:00	Robin Lehner	https://t.co/liSlBWapcF for the people out there that might not understand what it’s like dealing with mental illness. Listen to the king words in this song. @vinnie_paz seek help and do the best you can.
2021-07-28 10:47:53-04:00	Robin Lehner	@kenfury Don’t give up on trying different medications. Took me a long time to figure out what worked for me in different situations and many different medications I had to try. Also what worked before haven’t during covid with isolation so I had to keep trying new things again.

2021-07-27 23:45:19-04:00	Robin Lehner	@SameHere_Global @LeanRightAPA @TheoFleury14 It was my medicine until I was diagnosed and got medicine. The don’t have to be related… but they are until you get help. Problem is us it very hard to get help.
2021-07-27 23:36:04-04:00	Robin Lehner	@delcodave312 Tried lithium but I could not stop pucks on that. ❤️

My name is robin lehner and I’m bipolar 1 and have ptsd.I take medicine and I have a psychiatrist that I talk to once a week.I’m in the nhl program and on top of that I’ve fought trough hell to be here. And I’m pretty good at stopping pucks.Not perfect. Bless you all 🙏🐼❤️🤫
2021-07-27 23:14:53-04:00	Robin Lehner	@iExecuteOrdr66 Why? To not live in reality where the human kind don’t give a **** about each other? Time we all grow up to understand we as a society have huge issues. These people will face their own consequences.  I rather face my challenges then hide from them.

2021-07-27 21:55:19-04:00	Robin Lehner	There is not many people I’ve met or played with I respect as much as flower.  100% HOF guy that I will miss. But people that keep attacking my mental illness for something I don’t control. One day when your eyes close you will be judged and then don’t ask for forgiveness.

2021-05-29 21:41:39-04:00	Robin Lehner	@JodyWal38609898 @TSNSimmer @TSN1200 Nah it was a great decision. I was a mess there. Mistake was to let go of bishop.
2021-05-29 21:34:19-04:00	Robin Lehner	@BDGallof Well he is the goaltending coach.. he the one working with the goalies everyday and doing all the behind the scenes work. People don’t know because piero don’t care about the credit in media he just take care of his goalies. But it’s unfair to never give him credit.
2021-05-29 21:28:30-04:00	Robin Lehner	@SensCentral @TSNSimmer @TSN1200 😂  🍔  🦵 🐼 💀
2021-05-29 21:26:43-04:00	Robin Lehner	@TSNSimmer @TSN1200 Anytime my friend.
2021-05-29 21:23:36-04:00	Robin Lehner	@TSNSimmer Yeah since I was there it is Greco that does all the work with the goalies and he never gets the credit. Just wanted to shine light on it because he truly the one that deserve some praise. Changed my game and everyone else that been there since. Hope your doing well.
2021-05-29 21:16:48-04:00	Robin Lehner	@TSNSimmer People keep confusing that it’s piero Greco that is the goaltending coach and the one in charge there. Korn is great but Greco is the one that runs the goalies. Greco works wonders for goalies and one of the best humans there is. Korn is great but no one ever mention Greco.
2021-05-29 08:52:12-04:00	Robin Lehner	@Coyotesgrl @GoldenKnights Nah arizona scored to many goals on me this year and gave me 50% of my losses 😤

2021-05-29 06:18:45-04:00	Robin Lehner	@TheGildedJester Yeah and who has been telling you that? Clueless people that don’t understand the game. Media needs something to talk about and some wanna be media as well. Having two good goalies is something many teams that loose in the first round wish they had every year.
2021-05-29 06:05:05-04:00	Robin Lehner	@vegasborn83 @GoldenKnights That he will buy me a new one 🥰

2021-05-13 19:55:12-04:00	Robin Lehner	It’s an honor to be able to play with and get to know Marc. A fun prize for us to win together with the hard work of our entire team. Been really cool to see the special season Marc have had and I believe that’s where the Vezina belongs. Now the fun begins! https://t.co/XwfIiZijDu
2021-05-08 23:57:20-04:00	Robin Lehner	@darbielou1 Agreed. But if you look at what’s going on it’s a clear picture to predict. But not many want to look at it. As I said next gen will be the most affected.
2021-05-08 23:39:46-04:00	Robin Lehner	@SameHere_Global @cookingtheresa @CoreyHirsch @AlMacOdds @JesseGranger_ @KidsHelpPhone People also need to start understanding that mental health is linked with physical health as well. Prescriptions for anxiety are going up a lot and anxiety and link to heart disease / attack is big as well. Studies shows that benzo and sleeping pills are up a lot.
2021-05-08 22:34:12-04:00	Robin Lehner	@CoreyHirsch @cookingtheresa @AlMacOdds @JesseGranger_ @KidsHelpPhone On top of that people can’t afford medicine and the world are not accepting natural medicine. Addiction will sky rocket.Depression and anxiety is everywhere and people have lost jobs and businesses.Our kids and next generation will pay the price. Mental health kills fast and slow
2021-05-08 22:29:17-04:00	Robin Lehner	@CoreyHirsch @cookingtheresa @AlMacOdds @JesseGranger_ @KidsHelpPhone We need to open our perspective about mental health and study all what’s surrounding it. How many more people are suffering from mental health now? How much less life will you have when you start taking the meds? I know I probably won’t live to see my grand kids with what I’m on.
2021-05-08 22:09:04-04:00	Robin Lehner	@CoreyHirsch @cookingtheresa @AlMacOdds @JesseGranger_ @KidsHelpPhone It’s amazing what you can find out when you dig deep in to all of the mental health problems. Just media won’t show it. People in power won’t talk about it. Then people get angry at us that want to help all the people suffering.
2021-05-08 20:58:50-04:00	Robin Lehner	@RealKidPoker @AlMacOdds @JesseGranger_ 100% I just believe all decisions can’t just come from a one sided perspective. We have to look at the mental health side to all this as well that will be and is already very serious. Unfortunately media will only show the one side. So many people have lost in different ways.
2021-05-08 20:53:13-04:00	Robin Lehner	@AlMacOdds @JesseGranger_ How many people you think has died or will die because of mental health issues? How many dies every year from that? How many more will develop serious issues that will kill them long term? As I said time to discuss all the sides not just the virus.
2021-05-08 20:43:02-04:00	Robin Lehner	We don’t all have to agree. But we need to look at this from all angles and at the long term effect on our lives from this and how it’s handled. Our kids are going to have to carry a lot of this in to the future. In the end I just want us all to o get trough this together. ❤️
2021-05-08 20:43:01-04:00	Robin Lehner	Time for the organizations to show the impact on all the long term problems mental health will have from this. We are all going trough trauma right now and talking is not enough anymore. #bell let’s act.. @JoeBiden @JustinTrudeau
2021-05-08 20:43:01-04:00	Robin Lehner	It’s time for people to talk about how big the mental health impact on the world of the restrictions and lockdown. Time for media to report what is happening all over the world with mental health. It’s time for the mental health charities and organizations to act and speak up.
2021-05-08 20:43:01-04:00	Robin Lehner	Not the win. Not the great comeback from the guys. But the happiness and hope I saw in our arena yesterday filled me with joy and optimism. To see people have the freedom to do what makes them happy and mentally healthy. Mental health needs to be priority. https://t.co/i7YW835Ktk

2021-04-24 02:04:25-04:00	Robin Lehner	.... I just make things up I guess. https://t.co/sJeDPx3IP4
2021-04-21 18:50:12-04:00	Robin Lehner	I hope we can all work together to help people that suffers trough mental help from this going forward. I’ve heard how a lot of people are doing trough this as people talk to me about it.
2021-04-21 18:50:12-04:00	Robin Lehner	But this missed the mark. My bad to say it’s like prison and I apologize but with mental health issues that is developing in the world it develops problems mentally. We will see exactly how this effects everything with time. I don’t mean to offend anyone.
2021-04-21 18:50:11-04:00	Robin Lehner	To put competitive edge before well being of people lives is wrong. As I said people are struggling with many different things mentally and we need to consider that as well. Then being lied to makes it worse. I love hockey and the league has done a lot of good things.
2021-04-21 18:50:11-04:00	Robin Lehner	As I’m frustrated like a lot of people in the world right now everything didn’t come out of today’s press in the right way. Main point is that we need to start take the mental health important as well In this situation. It has a huge impact on everyone in society right now.

2020-10-03 18:02:06-04:00	Robin Lehner	I also want to thank @NHLBlackhawks @NYIslanders organizations and teammates there that helped me to this point. Especially fans in Long Island that truly changed my life and gave me the push I needed.

2020-10-03 16:47:58-04:00	Robin Lehner	And that’s ok. I work with psychiatrist and that’s ok. You work trough your issues as hard as you can and it’s possible to get rewarded whoever you are and no matter what you are dealing with.
2020-10-03 16:47:57-04:00	Robin Lehner	You make mistakes and you can learn from them. I’ve been extremely lucky to have some special people help me get to this point. This is also a big win for everyone with mental health issues out there. I’m an open person with bipolar 1, ptsd, anxiety And that’s ok. I take medicine
2020-10-03 16:47:57-04:00	Robin Lehner	Can’t put in to words how happy me and my family are to finally find a home. Especially in a fantastic place like las Vegas with this great team and organization. It’s been a long road to get here for me and I could not be any happier. Life is at times not easy and

2020-04-04 19:08:14-04:00	Robin Lehner	@darrenrovell Happy for you my friend!
2020-04-02 16:37:07-04:00	Robin Lehner	@SQL_Posse Behöver inte din respekt. Jag säger vad jag tycker. Vill inte att mina nära och kära ska dö för att Sverige ska göra tvärtom från resten av världen.
2020-04-02 16:30:38-04:00	Robin Lehner	@FolkeMoller Kunskap.. man kan väll vara logiskt.. fattar man inte att det är högre risk att sprida detta om man är ute bland folk så vet jag inte vad jag ska säga.. säger exakt vad jag vill. Glömde av att det är jobbigt att säga vad man tycker i Sverige.
2020-04-02 16:27:30-04:00	Robin Lehner	@SoderMalm1889 Absolut inte
2020-04-02 16:27:01-04:00	Robin Lehner	@KlaavePer Dom försöker ju i alla fall
2020-04-02 15:39:29-04:00	Robin Lehner	@mattiasldbg Står oftast
2020-04-02 15:14:53-04:00	Robin Lehner	@olofpalmer Absolut inte. Har all rätt att säga vad jag tycker.
2020-04-02 15:11:25-04:00	Robin Lehner	@stefanbrandt48 Ingen expert. Men ser vad som händer här borta och har många nära och kära med underliggande problem. Frustrerad att man inte gör något.
2020-04-02 15:07:39-04:00	Robin Lehner	@twainlindeth64 @GunnarP7 Om Vegas är redo att stänga hela staden och tänka på säkerheten först så känns det att Sverige kan göra det med.

2020-03-26 21:06:06-04:00	Robin Lehner	@AGrossNewsday Some context is I said don’t see it starting when we shut down at 1000 cases and how it starts when we will have 100k + cases... I hope I’m wrong and it slows down obviously.

All good it’s the society we live in.. Ben pope said my statistics should forgive my mental health issues..it’s all good.
2020-02-25 23:55:41-05:00	Robin Lehner	@johndietzdh Total lie. I said I wanted to be paid fair after you asked me if I would take less Becuse of my history. Easy for you guys to create your own narrative. It’s done and over with. Was willing to do short term. Money was never discussed. Life goes on. Enjoyed my time in Chicago.

2020-01-15 03:48:04-05:00	Robin Lehner	Good game. We need to keep getting those points! Montreal next!🐼 stay hot Kubalik! Clutch goal from the captain! Was kinda hoping for the shootout...
2020-01-13 04:50:57-05:00	Robin Lehner	@AGoToGuy321 @SameHere_Global @darrenrovell @TheoFleury14 i Developed bipolar from trauma and ptsd I’ve had it for a long time... just didn’t know I had it and how to treat it. I was also afraid to ask for help becuse there are so many people like you.
2020-01-13 04:45:12-05:00	Robin Lehner	@AGoToGuy321 Your right we as humans cant guarantee much. Athletes has the same my issues as everyone else..Many people hide there issues and don’t get help. I was open so hopefully others can get help. Teams signs people with multiple surgeries all the time. Many times it backfires..
2020-01-13 04:28:41-05:00	Robin Lehner	"@AGoToGuy321 @SameHere_Global @darrenrovell @TheoFleury14 With my medication I have no urge to drink. I drank with a purpose to calm
Down. Unless your bipolar it’s nothing I can explain to you my friend. I’ve tried. I’m doing this openly so people with similar issues gets some hope. Best of luck."
2020-01-13 04:23:14-05:00	Robin Lehner	@AGoToGuy321 It’s not any of those things it’s just reality and that’s why there are people killing them selfs in record numbers because society chooses to judge people with mental issues different. I don’t feel bad for my self. I embrace being bipolar. It’s who I am. I’m proud of who I am.
2020-01-13 04:14:08-05:00	Robin Lehner	@McBrooklyn48 @Shahrad66 @AGoToGuy321 @SameHere_Global @darrenrovell Agreed😂
2020-01-13 04:12:41-05:00	Robin Lehner	@AGoToGuy321 @darrenrovell @SameHere_Global @TheoFleury14 But too Judge my condition differently then a physical is the problem called stigma. predetermined thinking that we are gonna fail compared to the other and that it’s not possible to manage and have a stable and normal life. That’s why it’s harder for us to get back to normal.
2020-01-13 04:06:56-05:00	Robin Lehner	@Shahrad66 @AGoToGuy321 @SameHere_Global @darrenrovell Unfortunately this is how most people think and I deal with this everyday. This is what we are trying to change. The media has done it 2 times in the last week. Probably a lot more that I haven’t seen.
2020-01-13 04:04:44-05:00	Robin Lehner	@AGoToGuy321 @SameHere_Global @darrenrovell @TheoFleury14 It’s no different then a physical injury. I went to rehab and on my journey to know how to manage it. Knee or hip surgery they fix it and then have to manage it. Risk of problems after surgery and risk of me going back to hell are far from each other.
2020-01-13 03:58:40-05:00	Robin Lehner	@AGoToGuy321 @SameHere_Global @darrenrovell @TheoFleury14 They are safe when I’m now medicated and got the help I needed. Being bipolar without medication was hard. Only time I had peace was when drunk.. not anymore. This is the stigma tho.. unfortunately there are many more like you.
2020-01-13 03:43:19-05:00	Robin Lehner	@AGoToGuy321 @SameHere_Global @darrenrovell You have no clue what your talking about.
2020-01-12 04:24:17-05:00	Robin Lehner	Solid win tonight. Always fun to play in front of this crowd! Let’s finish of strong before the break and get back in the hunt. #Blackhawks 🐼
2020-01-10 23:20:29-05:00	Robin Lehner	@RichieHero7 @RealKidPoker @NickGismondi @NBCSChicago @CRoumeliotis It Was disrespectful... still hinting at people giving me a chance because my mh condition. Well proven it has no downside on my performance. People Keep bringing it up. I’ve worked for everything I’ve gotten and I always will.
2020-01-09 20:28:27-05:00	Robin Lehner	@DarrenDreger @TitanSports365 Yeah not a good idea to tell the media that you suffer those if he wants a new chance. Not saying he has but his agent would not tell the media if he did.

2019-12-20 04:16:25-05:00	Robin Lehner	Huge win in the north. #88 🐦was great tonight and 🐼was feeling it. Great job by everyone. Gotta keep getting better. Good night Chicago.
2019-12-16 23:58:47-05:00	Robin Lehner	See you soon Marc Crawford. Good to have you back!
2019-12-16 16:26:49-05:00	Robin Lehner	"Thanks for the honor 
@TheAthleticNHL
 and thanks for helping me spread my message that people aren’t alone out there struggling. Let’s be open and honest with each other and you will see how it will change your life. #samehere 🙏🐼"
2019-12-16 16:25:41-05:00	Robin Lehner	@brindacatstrome @TheAthleticNHL Yeah my Swedish is better:)
2019-12-16 03:01:24-05:00	Robin Lehner	Boys showed a lot of character today with a big bounce back effort after a tough stretch. With a sold out united center it’s not hard to get motivated. The boys and the fans was buzzin today! Let’s keep this rolling now. Hot tub time:) https://t.co/ywgqTeJIM5
2019-12-09 04:21:10-05:00	Robin Lehner	I should have listened to you @CMPunk next time..

2019-12-05 21:21:38-05:00	Robin Lehner	@Manskarlssonyao @hockeysverige Nu ska man säga det man tycker när hockey-Sverige tycker att det passar också.bra då vet jag. Prata om ämnet ur din synpunk. inte om vad jag väljer säga eller inte.Jag säger det jag upplever efter 10 år här borta och vad jag sett. Det som har hänt är inte ok. Har aldrig sagt det.
2019-12-04 20:01:07-05:00	Robin Lehner	Make it available for everyone please.
2019-12-04 19:58:58-05:00	Robin Lehner	Here it is..my own. Hopefully this can bring some change. https://t.co/9xHw0ShmOL
2019-12-04 19:48:09-05:00	Robin Lehner	@MattMcK2419 He does a lot I don’t agree with.
2019-12-04 19:46:24-05:00	Robin Lehner	For people interested please take time to listen to the whole conversation. My thoughts are my own. Could not stay silent on this as a person that currently are exercising his second chance. This will be my one and only time talking about this matter. https://t.co/gTRQNrANyB
2019-12-04 19:03:10-05:00	Robin Lehner	@kne_14 Understand why they have them and find ways to work on the root of certain issues but to not try to understand and just don’t have conversation and openness will guarantee no progress of moving forward in a healthier way. Does more hate make things better?
2019-12-04 18:41:05-05:00	Robin Lehner	Discussion and openness to our in differences are the only way to make someone understand your opinion or change it. The love or hate climate has to end. #lehnerthoughtoftheday
2019-12-04 18:41:05-05:00	Robin Lehner	It’s ok to disagree with each other. To have different views doesn’t mean some one is a bad person. Everyone’s views are shaped by the life they have lived and the culture they got shaped by. You most likely don’t know why they have their opinions and what it stems from.
2019-12-04 05:12:56-05:00	Robin Lehner	@MikeMcKenna56 Haha I’m weird when it comes to gloves.. I am switching to black pads for the first time let’s see how that works..as long as the skates are not sharp and the chest protector is soft I’m fine:)
2019-12-01 21:40:59-05:00	Robin Lehner	@NickGismondi @NHLBlackhawks @BlackhawksStore @Movember Noooo..:( should of kept it.

2019-11-28 22:27:21-05:00	Robin Lehner	I’m thankful for a second chance! Something I think we all deserve. also the food:) Happy thanksgiving everyone

2019-11-25 01:41:45-05:00	Robin Lehner	@mrkevinconnolly Yeah when people on Twitter think I’ve benefited from telling my story they are on something way more potent then I ever was.. god bless and get help.

2019-11-24 23:13:59-05:00	Robin Lehner	@Jhansing23 @jcgreenx Correct but at a very different speed. Thanks for the advice:)
2019-11-24 23:09:36-05:00	Robin Lehner	@R4938 Who said they were irrelevant..good advice tho..👍🔥
2019-11-24 23:03:49-05:00	Robin Lehner	@jcgreenx Yep my game is 80 % reading the plays and I can’t read the shootout.
2019-11-24 23:02:17-05:00	Robin Lehner	@xonichollexo 100% donya turns of the tv... she knows what is about to happen... 😂
2019-11-24 23:01:33-05:00	Robin Lehner	@Jon1443 Sure except I usually save those.. they are not in slow motion..
2019-11-24 22:51:34-05:00	Robin Lehner	@ChefSamMancuso Breakaways are way different and I tend to save most of those...
2019-11-24 22:41:44-05:00	Robin Lehner	@ByMHarrington Man I was hoping to get some help mike...
2019-11-24 22:38:36-05:00	Robin Lehner	@ByMHarrington got any tips?
2019-11-24 22:36:04-05:00	Robin Lehner	@Chris88313654 He is!
2019-11-24 22:35:54-05:00	Robin Lehner	@maslazak5 I’ll take this in to consideration

2019-11-24 22:34:29-05:00	Robin Lehner	@TheGing3rMan Good point
2019-11-24 22:30:33-05:00	Robin Lehner	Your opinion as well.. don’t be shy:) ❤️Let’s turn this together.🐼 happy Sunday.
2019-11-24 22:30:33-05:00	Robin Lehner	All the experts in the media on what my new shootout strategy should be:) I’m all ears. The shootout is not hockey so I gotta learn this sport somehow and hopefully one of the experts can help me as all my goalie coaches haven’t been able to yet. Sabres fans would love to hear
2019-11-24 22:30:33-05:00	Robin Lehner	First Let’s get this out of the way.. it’s not a mental problem becuse I don’t feel any type of pressure anymore. Proven that with my performance in contract years and in countless insane situations and I can still perform on the ice. So here we go..I wanna hear from
2019-11-24 22:14:04-05:00	Robin Lehner	@DrewMacDonald80 @heylandsberg @allevin18 Of course just talking about when people have depression witch I currently do not have issues with.
2019-11-24 22:07:20-05:00	Robin Lehner	@heylandsberg @allevin18 No energy..
2019-11-24 19:40:08-05:00	Robin Lehner	@MarkLazerus hahaha

2019-10-28 01:57:50-04:00	Robin Lehner	Big w for the boys! Now let’s keep this going. #Blackhawks
2019-10-19 04:22:09-04:00	Robin Lehner	Great feeling to get that first win with the boys. Great atmosphere tonight. Let’s keep building! #blackhawks
2019-10-12 00:47:35-04:00	Robin Lehner	That @joboych celly😂
2019-10-10 17:52:20-04:00	Robin Lehner	The culture of perfection is an illusion and it’s holding us back. Time to be real and understand we are all a part of the problem and stop lying about who we are to fit in too this insane system. #samehere #Military #police #fakestatistics
2019-10-10 17:52:20-04:00	Robin Lehner	Let’s give a thought to the men and women that has a job that creates trauma and MH issues and when they get it they have to suffer alone because transparency and help will loose you that job that created the problem in the first place. Keep talking but let’s start changing.
2019-09-29 14:50:26-04:00	Robin Lehner	@CoreyHirsch to be in a stressful and traumatic environment has effects on MH in bigger numbers then is being presented. Still society will pretend that people in these positions needs to be “perfect” and when talked about they will most likely not have their job anymore = silence and hiding.
2019-09-29 14:17:18-04:00	Robin Lehner	@CoreyHirsch Until we stop punishing MH issues this will keep happening. It’s heartbreaking.
2019-09-05 16:39:50-04:00	Robin Lehner	As I’ve joined the #SameHere Global Mental Health Alliance, I’m psyched that the next person to join us is @Scalabrine from the @nba. Fan favorite. He joins over 50 of &amp; growing, working together to share our stories of challenge. #5in5. Scal’s story: https://t.co/aQN7GYNT9W https://t.co/SwBDQKb1XS
2019-08-16 22:18:18-04:00	Robin Lehner	@JonasMallorca @realDonaldTrump First I don’t believe in the term a recovered one. I don’t believe I have all the answers. I believe if I want change you have to do something. World can be changed with enough people joining the same cause. #SameHere
2019-08-16 01:03:44-04:00	Robin Lehner	@heylandsberg Corporate structure don’t allow people to show weakness without punishment. The people at the top are dealing with issues as well but corporate world don’t allow transparency without associate it with risk. Starts at the top.
2019-08-16 00:25:08-04:00	Robin Lehner	Encourage people to listen to the interview as a whole in the link. #SameHere https://t.co/NECA8Pv0NL
2019-08-14 19:02:21-04:00	Robin Lehner	Change only happens trough interaction and understanding one another. Not trying guarantees failure. Start a dialogue for progress.
2019-08-14 18:20:47-04:00	Robin Lehner	"along with programs that promote mental health education. Your people are suffering and you hold the key to make it better.
@realdonaldtrump how about we sit down and discuss this.  Allow me to share my experience with you.  Let’s make a difference.  Thank you"
2019-08-14 18:20:46-04:00	Robin Lehner	In this country it’s clear we have an issue with addiction, violence, and we are even facing a suicide crisis.  The only way we can make a dent and fix the issues above is to devise a system that gets healthcare and medication cost under control,
2019-08-14 17:05:57-04:00	Robin Lehner	Honestly this is bothering me quite a bit. I’m one of the lucky ones because I’m covered but I just saw the price tag on the 5 medications I’m taking and it’s around 4 k per month. Pure insanity. If countries want a healthy population and less issues they gotta start there!
2019-08-13 19:40:43-04:00	Robin Lehner	#SameHere is an expression which means: I’ve faced challenges in life too. Those challenges have affected my mental health.  It’s a sign that we hope will unite the world to once and for all, normalize how universal this topic is. https://t.co/gWsuDIwkMR

2019-08-02 20:03:42-04:00	Robin Lehner	@TheHockeyNews Should not be a gated article...
2019-07-23 21:24:16-04:00	Robin Lehner	@cmassey99 @AllALittleCrazy @darrenrovell @mjrotter @Johnubacon Unfortunately people in power needs to be more careful then others in how they word and approach certain subjects. Same with me with that if I don’t think before I speak I risk setting back what I fight for instead of making it better.
2019-07-23 21:15:06-04:00	Robin Lehner	@dougastevens @darrenrovell To be fair it’s the same issue everywhere that if you don’t make these talks about MH or drugs or whatever it may be mandatory a lot of people doesn’t show up. Same with the nhl if they don’t make the yearly security talk mandatory majority of the team probably would not attend.
