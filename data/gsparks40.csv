I will never forget that encounter, the night a true legend made me
2017-12-27 01:10:35-05:00	Garret Sparks	I met Johnny Bower before a game in the away room in Owen Sound.

2016-01-06 02:38:12-05:00	Garret Sparks	Panarin goal was filthy. 3 on 3 OT is chaos. Hockey is awesome.
2016-01-06 00:13:19-05:00	Garret Sparks	Watching @kasperikapanen1's OT winner in Finnish just gave me chills. Amazing moment for Finnish hockey &amp; one of its brightest young stars.

2015-12-23 16:03:48-05:00	Garret Sparks	When I see things like this though it's a little disheartening. If you want something signed don't buy it, just ask. https://t.co/WKNRjRuEpN

2015-11-08 04:44:36-05:00	Garret Sparks	You let NHL teams trade chances for 60 mins with no systems/structure (NHL All star game) &amp; there's 20 goals a game. That's the difference.
2015-11-08 04:37:28-05:00	Garret Sparks	The game is lower scoring because the emphasis on defensive structure is at an all time high. That's the difference between 80's NHL &amp; now.
2015-11-08 04:34:39-05:00	Garret Sparks	Hot take: Keep nets the same size and figure out a way to beat smarter and more athletic goalies.

2015-06-08 00:48:28-04:00	Garret Sparks	Invest all the money you wasted on small nets on basic goalie coaching education for all youth programs @TheGoalieGuild
2015-06-08 00:23:01-04:00	Garret Sparks	@joshrw26 @TheGoalieGuild Some have it in their blood, some don't. Don't be afraid to distinguish that from an early age.
2015-06-08 00:14:23-04:00	Garret Sparks	@simrd1 @usahockey kids had to pick corners on me, idk what goalies you are watching :) Smaller goalie = get out of the crease w/ skating.
2015-06-08 00:10:12-04:00	Garret Sparks	@simrd1 @usahockey At least they get to work at picking corners it just gets harder with age. Goalies lose formative years of skating basics
2015-06-08 00:05:21-04:00	Garret Sparks	@BigMitch_30 @usahockey Firmly believe getting scored on is just as important as making saves at that age.
2015-06-08 00:03:53-04:00	Garret Sparks	@BigMitch_30 @usahockey of course it is hard. It is a challenge. If it was easy to play goalie everybody would do it.
2015-06-08 00:02:42-04:00	Garret Sparks	How's a kid gonna to learn to move in the crease when he's this big? No need to push, recover, etc. Just sit &amp; block. http://t.co/cYSDoUgoxm
2015-06-07 23:54:57-04:00	Garret Sparks	enough and hate getting scored on enough to make sure you don't get scored on again. I hate that even hockey has become a feel good factory.
2015-06-07 23:53:58-04:00	Garret Sparks	You shouldn't feel like Ben Bishop at age 7. You shouldn't have a .930 sv% in mites. You should get scored on again and again until you work
2015-06-07 23:53:17-04:00	Garret Sparks	Rant: The mini nets @usahockey uses for mites now will only make young goalies rely on size instead of skating from the beginning.

2014-11-20 02:19:10-05:00	Garret Sparks	@TheGoalieGuild yeah you have to really stick it mid shin on a situation like that and sacrifice depth. Better hope he's going short side!
2014-11-20 02:15:19-05:00	Garret Sparks	@TheGoalieGuild that's a bad example. There's no control when you're going pad in while sliding, unless you're hitting mid shin.
2014-11-19 23:28:44-05:00	Garret Sparks	@NikkiMTL they all are. But because being sad isn't cool they internalize it &amp; convert it into Taylor Swift lyrics for under insta selfies.

2014-11-12 16:13:34-05:00	Garret Sparks	@TheGoalieGuild @BlueCrease a few inches of depth there is all the difference in the world. That's prime shooting area + stick in lane.

2014-05-08 01:27:43-04:00	Garret Sparks	I predicted North Bay to get throttled at least one game this series by @Storm_City, but 10-1? This team is scary when it clicks. #1MoreW
2014-05-07 02:28:28-04:00	Garret Sparks	@warriorstickguy I'd say I can be high profile haha. One of those would go really well with my AX1 gloves at @GGSunited camp this summer.

2014-01-26 17:55:59-05:00	Garret Sparks	Jay-Z would've been a way more solid choice for NY. I imagine his price tag &amp; total disregard for the sport of hockey was an issue though.

2014-01-26 03:55:54-05:00	Garret Sparks	@harrygaydosz I still have quite the collection from my childhood. Any penny I got 'til I turned 13 I sunk into trains.
2014-01-26 03:52:14-05:00	Garret Sparks	@harrygaydosz Something I also enjoy doing haha. And playing goalie. 3/3 as far as weird hobbies I guess. You have any models?
2014-01-26 03:49:24-05:00	Garret Sparks	@harrygaydosz I live on the Union Pacific line &amp; a CN spur. I'm spoiled in that respect. Rarely see BNSF units though.
2014-01-26 03:47:50-05:00	Garret Sparks	@harrygaydosz My love for trains is something I can't even begin to explain to people. Just don't quite know how to explain it haha.
2014-01-26 03:45:00-05:00	Garret Sparks	@harrygaydosz I've seen a trio of CNW units, WP, SP, &amp; Rio Grande. Live on the mainline in Chi. Have spent a lot of summer nights watching.
2014-01-26 03:42:51-05:00	Garret Sparks	@harrygaydosz to be honest both Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific would be my first two choices. BNSF is forever my favorite though.
2014-01-26 03:39:26-05:00	Garret Sparks	@harrygaydosz Had no idea #NS was doing heritage units similar to Union Pacific. Gorgeous. I've been lucky enough to see all of the UP ones.

2014-01-26 03:26:15-05:00	Garret Sparks	To be honest though I'd much rather see two SoCal teams duke it out on wheels. Now that would be a spectacle. #SchoolYardPuck #OutdoorRoller

2014-01-05 20:32:16-05:00	Garret Sparks	Canada can bring 11 players back next year on home soil. Have to feel for the 19 y/o's left off in favor of younger, returning players.

2013-10-31 03:51:07-04:00	Garret Sparks	Bartender ranting about overpaid athletes and I'm just hiding over here behind my water trying to escape his wrath.
2013-10-31 03:39:29-04:00	Garret Sparks	The clapping person just got into a fight with someone on her phone. I think we all experienced our own ballet tonight. A ballet of emotion.
2013-10-31 03:26:22-04:00	Garret Sparks	The Red Sox win the World Series and a single person claps in the hotel lobby. #Classic
2013-10-30 22:51:12-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ali_petrone Sorry it took so long to get it out. Just a little shy is all.
2013-10-30 22:47:19-04:00	Garret Sparks	Might as well pick the coolest chick I know for my first #WCW @ali_petrone #StayHot
2013-10-30 22:11:25-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ashtag_nelson Should I notify @eriealerts?
2013-10-30 17:54:26-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ashtag_nelson present.

2013-10-30 02:42:19-04:00	Garret Sparks	@afoss5 @Buttery_Blakes Where do you live in the summer?
2013-10-30 02:24:26-04:00	Garret Sparks	@afoss5 @Buttery_Blakes Hahaha yeah it's a big deal... #UhNo #FutureLemonhead?
2013-10-30 01:48:36-04:00	Garret Sparks	So we learned that @gmckegg14 is definitely afraid of the corners at @screemers tonight... #Boo
2013-10-30 01:40:34-04:00	Garret Sparks	@rockwoodsfinest @DanCleghorn @eriealerts Erie alerts is the best account on twitter, just saying.

2013-10-30 01:33:27-04:00	Garret Sparks	I'd rather sit through a pre-school's rendition of West Side Story than watch an NBA game. And I hate West Side Story. And kids. #JudgeMe

2013-10-29 19:12:40-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ashtag_nelson I have better odds of winning the lottery. And I never play the lottery. Good luck though.
2013-10-29 03:42:02-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Dan_Meagher her loss.
2013-10-29 03:05:41-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ECruicks18 @ThePowerHouse12 it would be pizza. If I'm not mistaken.
2013-10-29 03:03:36-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ECruicks18 then it wouldn't be frozen ya dingus @ThePowerHouse12  back me up on this one.
2013-10-29 02:59:43-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ECruicks18 completely illogical. Freezer burn? Sick joke? Need details #confused #concerned

2013-10-28 23:38:29-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ThePenmanship @melon_29 @RLevin92 @Tinder the most distant thing ever.
2013-10-28 22:57:56-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ali_petrone well I sure hope you didn't hahaha. I'd be scared if you did #FreeCandy #ForTheKids

2013-10-27 22:28:19-04:00	Garret Sparks	You and I pace along the grass, and think of what we had, ambivalent and young, but probably just dumb. #TakeMeBack #Wavves #Lolla

2013-10-27 03:05:37-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Grace_Leafs that's tough, hockey is my true passion. Maybe a train engineer or artist..?
2013-10-27 03:04:58-04:00	Garret Sparks	@MarleafB I think that time has past haha.
2013-10-27 03:04:38-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Whiteleaf55 @TorontoMarlies haha I didn't know I had fans!!

2013-07-04 01:17:57-04:00	Garret Sparks	Watching our semi-final game vs. Canada. Still get chills.

2013-07-03 21:25:53-04:00	Garret Sparks	@AidanArmstrong9 Miller for lil' Danny B.
2013-07-03 21:25:10-04:00	Garret Sparks	Either that or a team on the west coast will trade for him (Which is what he'd want) but I don't see that happening.
2013-07-03 21:23:56-04:00	Garret Sparks	Miller is totally going to Philly...
2013-07-03 20:39:52-04:00	Garret Sparks	@dansi5151 I understand the business side I really do. I understand the move. I don't understand the fan resentment. It's misguided.
2013-07-03 20:35:33-04:00	Garret Sparks	@dansi5151 I was there for two months, including a playoff run. How can you pass judgment never coming within 50 feet of the man?
2013-07-03 20:21:52-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Jeffler I understand that. I don't understand the resentment most people have of him though, not just his contract.
2013-07-03 20:20:33-04:00	Garret Sparks	Maybe he wasn't paid $4M to be a Marlie, but you will realize the value of his stay when the D prospects find their way to the big club.
2013-07-03 20:16:19-04:00	Garret Sparks	Any fan praising Komisarek's buyout doesn't understand the incredibly positive impact he had on the @TorontoMarlies this season.
2013-07-03 18:50:22-04:00	Garret Sparks	@19Vesey @s_ghost14 I can hang with that.

2013-05-10 02:29:15-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Figzy13 I see a bit of myself too. He's an example of something to work towards.
2013-05-10 02:28:43-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Mike_Fahmy No he's definitely someone I'd like to play like.
2013-05-10 02:27:57-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 I mean I like Emery more. But Crawford is definitely improving. Give him 2 more seasons and he'll really start impressing you.
2013-05-10 02:24:14-04:00	Garret Sparks	The more I watch Corey Crawford the more he impresses me. He has an incredible physical skill set. A lot to like about his game.

2013-01-03 11:41:03-05:00	Garret Sparks	I pictured it but it's something I'll never forget. 1 more game for this team to cement it's legacy. It's been a great ride so far. #USAWJC
2013-01-03 11:39:28-05:00	Garret Sparks	I said at the beginning of this tournament to my goalie coach all I wanted was to be on the ice when we beat Canada. It wasn't quite how..
2013-01-03 11:17:43-05:00	Garret Sparks	@KyleMorris81 still have more World J medals than you. And more class.
2013-01-03 11:13:28-05:00	Garret Sparks	This is the greatest feeling in the world #USAWJC

2012-06-08 13:57:11-04:00	Garret Sparks	@nastynatedawg32 I've done it before, I could do it again haha.
2012-06-08 03:02:25-04:00	Garret Sparks	@PuckCentralHQ I mean that was the game winner with 3 seconds left but.. Who's counting? #AllHailNail

2012-06-08 02:45:50-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke It's okay. I'm selling the Bauer ones to get these. Plus I'm doing work around the house for a cool $200. #Dontpanic.
2012-06-08 02:44:05-04:00	Garret Sparks	As you watch coverage on Nail Yakupov and the upcoming draft, you may see me get scored on. Feel free to point and laugh at my expense.
2012-06-08 02:42:26-04:00	Garret Sparks	@BizNasty2pointO Hahaha predictable. #AllHailNail
2012-06-08 02:40:35-04:00	Garret Sparks	@BizNasty2pointO Getting scored on..?

2012-06-07 02:50:46-04:00	Garret Sparks	So if I'm a Sutter here I tell Kopi not to cross the red line in the defensive zone on the PK. Make it a 4 on 3 and #goforit.
2012-06-07 02:30:20-04:00	Garret Sparks	That's hockey karma. Interference on Quick? That's fine Doughty will just go 5 cheese and even things up.

2012-06-05 23:37:13-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Tophdog5 Well I saw him at like 4:30. For having a skateboard he didn't get very far. What a guy.

2012-06-05 22:40:26-04:00	Garret Sparks	Matt Sullivan sighting!! In his natural habitat. Carrying a skateboard to Southtown because he can't actually ride it. #locallegend
2012-06-05 18:33:41-04:00	Garret Sparks	@kylepereira I'd be offended if you didn't.

2012-06-02 18:13:12-04:00	Garret Sparks	Taking a 5 question survey for free wifi at the Buffalo Niagara International Airport is the fairest compromise I have ever encountered.

2012-05-25 16:17:32-04:00	Garret Sparks	@bertrand93 outside of Bemidji,MN on Leech Lake.
2012-05-25 15:47:50-04:00	Garret Sparks	Back to the wittle fish on Lake Redstone. Don't worry @Blakes_16 I'll take yours off.
2012-05-25 15:47:03-04:00	Garret Sparks	And with that, the week of fishing is over. Very disappointed in my inability to catch a nice walleye or two #snakebitten.
2012-05-25 15:44:32-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ECruicks18 Get ready for some @LemonheadHC hockey, that's what!
2012-05-25 12:00:20-04:00	Garret Sparks	@hitchhiker29 It is a fish reference, but do you see any rainbow trout in Missy...? And yeah I'll be at prospect camp again this year.
2012-05-25 04:52:29-04:00	Garret Sparks	If I didn't have problems I'd have nothing at all.
2012-05-25 03:55:34-04:00	Garret Sparks	So if Steelheads/Lakers were possible names for Missy, does that mean franchise has a foot out the door and is looking towards Hamilton...?
2012-05-25 03:52:17-04:00	Garret Sparks	@LauraLilMissQs My guess on jerseys is white, silver, navy, and some baby blue if we're lucky.
2012-05-25 03:51:53-04:00	Garret Sparks	@LauraLilMissQs I would've prefered Lakers and gone purple and gold like LA. That would've been much better than steelheads.
2012-05-25 03:47:08-04:00	Garret Sparks	@LauraLilMissQs Please tell me you're kidding... That's horrid. I could think of 25 better names off the top of my head.

2012-04-25 15:24:52-04:00	Garret Sparks	1st time it hits 85 I'm getting on a train and hitting the beach. @Blakes_16 @jgarp31 sound like a plan?
2012-04-25 15:23:04-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Blakes_16 Well she's got us there. #wearedumb.
2012-04-25 15:15:21-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Blakes_16 Haha classic quotes from the Blaker house.
2012-04-25 03:52:12-04:00	Garret Sparks	@thefrench_ too true. I look like I got in a bar fight. Bruised face and everything.

2012-04-21 01:56:04-04:00	Garret Sparks	Going into OT here in Niagara knotted at 1. #Ottawa #Niagara #OHLplayoffs.
2012-04-20 20:23:58-04:00	Garret Sparks	Last exam in the books. 4 essays in under 2 hrs. I need a shoulder massage #STAT. Should've gone multiple choice....
2012-04-20 03:10:24-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Funkdatass33 Agreed agreed agreed.
2012-04-20 03:07:46-04:00	Garret Sparks	@platour68 That was my only point. I just don't think he's NHL ready yet. Hopefully these playoffs give him a lot of valuable experience.
2012-04-20 02:59:06-04:00	Garret Sparks	@platour68 Not saying he'll never be a good NHL player, but he isn't there yet, why force it.
2012-04-20 02:55:56-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Funkdatass33 One thing you'll notice about all 3 Crawford OT goals is his lack of compete. Content to let whatever happens, happen.
2012-04-20 02:53:44-04:00	Garret Sparks	Say what you want about Crawford, but you just don't pinch in OT on a 50/50 puck with nothing to be gained. #hockeysense #getsome.
2012-04-20 02:49:52-04:00	Garret Sparks	Dear Blackhawks, as much as you want Nick Leddy to be an NHL defenseman, he's not. He's a liability. Figure. It. Out.
2012-04-20 02:45:39-04:00	Garret Sparks	@intheoradio @allyrenae I called Saad all by myself #trailblazer.
2012-04-20 02:41:38-04:00	Garret Sparks	I like the way you think, @TSNBobMcKenzie. #BrandonSaad

2012-04-20 02:32:57-04:00	Garret Sparks	Brandon Saad for the game winner. #whynot.
2012-04-20 00:08:45-04:00	Garret Sparks	Pizza, hot dogs, and anthems. All better #chicagostyle.
2012-04-19 22:11:00-04:00	Garret Sparks	@TML_Crystal Haha I saw those today. Too funny.
2012-04-19 21:54:58-04:00	Garret Sparks	4 really solid playoff games on the line tonight. Great time to be hockey fan.
2012-04-19 21:43:09-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 whoever said cut it is a joke.
2012-04-19 21:36:15-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke @jgarp31 Like.
2012-04-19 01:49:09-04:00	Garret Sparks	So as this Pit-Phi game winds down the elephant in the room is named #MichaelLeighton.... #3peat? Would be comical.
2012-04-19 01:24:42-04:00	Garret Sparks	Bobrovsky!! You're off the case!!! Turn in your badge & gun. #loosecannon
2012-04-19 01:17:42-04:00	Garret Sparks	The Flyers-Pens series is a real defensive battle. #Thingsnobodysays
2012-04-19 01:09:39-04:00	Garret Sparks	Is that Tommy Salo in net for Philly? #brutal
2012-04-19 00:56:26-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 7-6*
2012-04-19 00:55:19-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 idk why everyone is hating on bryz.. 5-3 PIT is like a guaranteed 7-5 win by Philly.
2012-04-19 00:51:29-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 You could play for the Flyers with your gear.
2012-04-18 22:46:45-04:00	Garret Sparks	Who wants to go fishing tomorrow?
2012-04-18 20:51:28-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Tieja_Mac Uh, I'm here now. Held against my will doing final exams.
2012-04-18 20:45:42-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Tieja_Mac RT it!!!!!!!!!!!
2012-04-18 20:45:18-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Tieja_Mac Then I've done my job.
2012-04-18 20:42:24-04:00	Garret Sparks	I think this is the consistency in player protection and punishment everyone has been looking for http://t.co/psow2EDH
2012-04-18 18:42:16-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 Looky what I made #paintskills http://t.co/p8Ee29MW
2012-04-18 17:52:42-04:00	Garret Sparks	But honestly, who's ready to see L.A. wrap this one up tonight? #Quickforpresident
2012-04-18 17:47:32-04:00	Garret Sparks	Killed it on my essay and wrapped up 1st exam. #TOOEASY.

2012-04-18 04:18:07-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke @jgarp31 She's right, I could've saved that.
2012-04-18 02:57:15-04:00	Garret Sparks	"""@blairpacheco: @GSparks40 WWGSD? #whatwouldgarretsparksdo"" Finish the SO and pump him after #certifiedtoughguy."
2012-04-18 02:53:10-04:00	Garret Sparks	Why not start Emery for the 3rd though..? http://t.co/cuBnTlln
2012-04-18 02:51:58-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ChrisMcdonald91 Crawford was telling Smith how the Wiley Coyote theme was genius but poorly executed.
2012-04-18 02:50:23-04:00	Garret Sparks	@S_Lekkas Would've been a bloodbath.
2012-04-18 02:45:16-04:00	Garret Sparks	Silly bandwagon fans. A: they were nowhere close to fighting. B: Crawford would've gotten pumped. http://t.co/wppTrDAw
2012-04-18 01:35:33-04:00	Garret Sparks	What I'm gathering here is Torres hit Hossa and the entire city of Chicago is rather upset.. I should be watching this game.
2012-04-18 01:22:51-04:00	Garret Sparks	Great game going on in Ottawa right now. #WOW. Ott takes lead with 21.4 left and Bar TIES it w/ 7 seconds left? Crazy.
2012-04-18 01:01:31-04:00	Garret Sparks	@batodoinwork That sounds rough. I'll give you consistent D this summer.
2012-04-18 00:58:25-04:00	Garret Sparks	@batodoinwork HAHAHA blunt. Love it. Ps nice shut out last night Batoqvist
2012-04-17 23:32:46-04:00	Garret Sparks	@annamarierose10 where are you working out once home?
2012-04-17 23:20:01-04:00	Garret Sparks	@bdecoppel Which is an interesting issue, as he's 1 goalie who has had a history of concussions.
2012-04-17 23:16:56-04:00	Garret Sparks	@annamarierose10 teach me.
2012-04-17 23:15:23-04:00	Garret Sparks	@SandyRStuckless Don't disagree with that. It is frustrating when somethings are treated differently because of who committed them.
2012-04-17 23:13:41-04:00	Garret Sparks	@LeafsWriterBR ..level of consistency needs to be found eventually.
2012-04-17 23:13:23-04:00	Garret Sparks	@LeafsWriterBR It's a difficult job and a lot of tough decisions to be made. I think it is a bit unfair to heap the blame on him. But some..
2012-04-17 23:11:44-04:00	Garret Sparks	@LeafsWriterBR Very good point. I think inconsistency is at the heart of the issue. Does Shaw get 3 if Smith attempts to absorb hit?
2012-04-17 23:09:13-04:00	Garret Sparks	My only complaint is that it has the potential to impact the series. 3 gms in the middle of a series is a lot different than 3 gms in Oct.
2012-04-17 23:05:19-04:00	Garret Sparks	What is everyone else's opinion on the Shaw suspension?
2012-04-17 23:03:17-04:00	Garret Sparks	I'm all for goalies being protected and all, but that Shaw hit was not worthy of 3 games. Either way, it is what it is.
2012-04-17 18:13:41-04:00	Garret Sparks	@sliceofpezza Hahaha that's what I'm saying! No one is taking the time to watch it though.
2012-04-17 17:54:05-04:00	Garret Sparks	Had to post this again. I don't think enough people watched it last time. It is everything a hockey video should be http://t.co/GlIvpgve
2012-04-17 17:20:33-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Blakes_16 okay.
2012-04-17 17:17:06-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Blakes_16 Prove it.
2012-04-17 17:16:34-04:00	Garret Sparks	@evnmacdonald It sounds worse than anything anyone could've imagined.
2012-04-17 16:43:05-04:00	Garret Sparks	@xcandaceee That's what I'm thinking. No good can come of it.
2012-04-17 16:32:10-04:00	Garret Sparks	@barryweston TImeline is soooooo mainstream.
2012-04-17 16:26:08-04:00	Garret Sparks	"As much as I like clicking buttons, I refuse to click ""Get Timeline Now"" out of fear of what could happen."
2012-04-16 20:55:17-04:00	Garret Sparks	Logging some serious minutes on the road.
2012-04-16 18:16:23-04:00	Garret Sparks	Rockin' my way down 94. Back to our Northerly neighbor for a few days.
2012-04-16 17:03:01-04:00	Garret Sparks	@nastynatedawg32 idk I'm in Indiana right now. I'll keep you posted.
2012-04-16 14:53:41-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 You couldn't have been the genius that came up with this..
2012-04-16 05:59:28-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke #realtalk is a great hashtag. Thanks for hanging out with me.
2012-04-16 05:36:37-04:00	Garret Sparks	What's more disappointing; Losing in Game 7 of the Cup finals, or getting swept in the first round when you were picked to return? #toughQ.
2012-04-16 05:32:52-04:00	Garret Sparks	@nastynatedawg32 Driving back to Guelph tomorrow. Hit up Chipotle with me in Lansing.
2012-04-15 21:28:53-04:00	Garret Sparks	Welcome to the club, Brent.
2012-04-15 21:27:34-04:00	Garret Sparks	Hey Brent. How you doin'?
2012-04-15 21:15:39-04:00	Garret Sparks	@TML_Crystal Philly. They just look too powerful.
2012-04-15 21:13:41-04:00	Garret Sparks	Who does everyone have for game winners? I have Jagr for the Flyers and Bryzgalov for the Pens #oops
2012-04-15 20:51:46-04:00	Garret Sparks	Neal was celebrating by the time Bryz reacted. #Impressive.
2012-04-15 20:10:51-04:00	Garret Sparks	If there are hockey gods, they'll give us two more periods like the 1st one. #PIT #PHILLY #WILD!!!!!
2012-04-15 17:34:01-04:00	Garret Sparks	@JanneMakkonen1 very true. Very hard to find HD highlights anywhere of OHL. Maybe some day.
2012-04-15 02:36:00-04:00	Garret Sparks	@swaghockey Boy do i love that band.
2012-04-15 02:35:32-04:00	Garret Sparks	@intheoradio Yeah you gotta hit the seam play.
2012-04-14 17:28:02-04:00	Garret Sparks	@intheoradio Shoot the gap.
2012-04-14 00:10:43-04:00	Garret Sparks	On that note, the momentum of a big save. Bryz made the difference between 2-1 and 3-0.
2012-04-14 00:09:48-04:00	Garret Sparks	Woohoo! Nice pizza Sid.
2012-04-13 16:33:00-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Jgarp31 So if I'm keeping a running tab, that's a girls lacrosse team, a hockey bro, a hot mom, and no crying babies? That's a good flight.
2012-04-13 16:29:02-04:00	Garret Sparks	@JanneMakkonen1 You should do a similar edit for the OHL next season. Loved the video.
2012-04-13 06:34:00-04:00	Garret Sparks	If you haven't seen this, do yourself a favor and watch. If it doesn't get you going, check your pulse. http://t.co/Pk8uNV2a
2012-04-13 05:15:08-04:00	Garret Sparks	@batodoinwork Just gotta put it behind us!
2012-04-13 05:12:33-04:00	Garret Sparks	@batodoinwork That's very true.
2012-04-13 05:09:04-04:00	Garret Sparks	@batodoinwork A lot of bad decisions made by the D. Oh well. #game2.
2012-04-13 04:56:21-04:00	Garret Sparks	@CarcelMousineau Haha can never be too sure! And I just want another parade on Michigan Ave. haha.
2012-04-13 04:50:30-04:00	Garret Sparks	@CarcelMousineau Which means unfortunately I don't have a horse in this years race. I'll take my hometown team then.
2012-04-13 04:44:00-04:00	Garret Sparks	After this: http://t.co/XmKTvsUr And this: http://t.co/vjS9S04F How can anyone bet against this team in the dying minutes?
2012-04-13 04:33:02-04:00	Garret Sparks	Never go to sleep on the Hawks. 80% of bandwagon fans missed what playoffs are all about. #OT
2012-04-13 02:48:05-04:00	Garret Sparks	STL-SJ takes me back to the beginning of my hockey fandom. This is going to be a great series.

2012-04-09 23:11:56-04:00	Garret Sparks	Back on the ice with @jgarp31 @bobbybigwheels9 @Blakes_16.
2012-04-09 19:01:16-04:00	Garret Sparks	@hinch999 first of many this summer.
2012-04-09 03:36:09-04:00	Garret Sparks	Great Easter with my chicky @stephlemke. It was great being home + seeing who you love. 2 easters was aggressive. Might go run tomorrow.
2012-04-09 03:19:30-04:00	Garret Sparks	Last time I checked 'Workaholics' didn't mean 'One Tree Hill'. #thatshowisawful #figureitout. Right @Blakes_16?
2012-04-08 15:55:13-04:00	Garret Sparks	Congrats to all the Mission U16 players who got picked in the OHL draft. You might laugh now, but #youneverknow.

2012-03-31 03:10:25-04:00	Garret Sparks	@WUUUUUUUHHAPPEN For my sake, I hope you're wrong.
2012-03-31 03:09:45-04:00	Garret Sparks	@lizzybates Don't do that. That's not nice.
2012-03-30 16:59:17-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ashley_nelson3 I almost went to Moe's when I visited but then I remembered I don't like the taste of dog crap.

2012-03-25 03:59:49-04:00	Garret Sparks	@hsaia23 @jgarp31 ...In conclusion I've decided its a totally fake smile because Joey is not there, which means you can't be THAT happy.
2012-03-25 03:59:14-04:00	Garret Sparks	@hsaia23 @jgarp31 ...... how do you hold a conversation with this girl. In the pic you're all like, :D, and Joey isn't there. SO....
2012-03-25 03:55:14-04:00	Garret Sparks	@hsaia23 Just gonna go out on a limb and say you aren't actually that happy considering @jgarp31 is nowhere to be found. #faker.

2012-03-19 02:16:04-04:00	Garret Sparks	@_Happy_Gilmore Sounds terrible for both of them. Hope neither of them suffered.
2012-03-19 01:53:45-04:00	Garret Sparks	@_Happy_Gilmore How's that nice girlfriend of yours doing?
2012-03-19 01:49:54-04:00	Garret Sparks	@_Happy_Gilmore Yeah. Only 364 more days 'til next year though. Gotta toughen up.

2012-03-17 16:08:02-04:00	Garret Sparks	So now with playoffs on the line.. What should I do with my hair? Leaning towards the Skrillex buzz &amp; flow. Taking suggestions.
2012-03-17 15:59:10-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Blakes_16 Son, you lost that fight. Did you get hit by a train?
2012-03-17 15:45:49-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke A: Stop twitter stalking me. B: Worry about yourself. As far as I'm concerned, I've been playing playoff games for a month now.

2012-03-16 20:08:52-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Heardy15 Just be careful out there. Bump into anybody too hard and you might not play 'til the 2nd round.
2012-03-16 20:06:56-04:00	Garret Sparks	@lclichtenberger Starting to sound like @stephlemke. That's not a road you want to go down. #onlineshoppingaddict.

2012-03-14 19:44:32-04:00	Garret Sparks	I would love to see a Champions League match live. What an atmosphere.
2012-03-14 19:18:03-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Blakes_16 Jealous!

2012-03-12 02:11:14-04:00	Garret Sparks	@intheoradio I could be the one to bring them back together. #electrictriangle #3rdstringvocals
2012-03-12 01:51:41-04:00	Garret Sparks	Oh add Bayside to the list of bands I wouldn't hate being in either. Those guys are geniuses.
2012-03-12 01:10:36-04:00	Garret Sparks	I wish I was in Incubus. That'd be sick. #nicetoknowyou.
2012-03-11 23:42:44-04:00	Garret Sparks	That was one ugly win, but at this point of the season a win is a win. And that's all that matters. #teamfirst #playoffpush
2012-03-11 16:06:08-04:00	Garret Sparks	How about an add @MdashFINN @TheK0S @ginner_21?
2012-03-11 16:04:45-04:00	Garret Sparks	Just realized I have a total of 8 bbm contacts... #pathetic #needfriends.

2012-03-09 21:33:06-05:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke Might be your all time best line. #dontreallyhateyou
2012-03-09 21:31:18-05:00	Garret Sparks	@mole_reebokgoal Uh, yeah. #getmeone
2012-03-09 19:14:44-05:00	Garret Sparks	#springbreak huh? Yeah I'd rather be playing hockey anyways. 5 games in 8 days to finish the regular season. Wouldn't trade it for anything.
2012-03-09 18:13:56-05:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 I didn't claim I made it. Obviously I didn't.
2012-03-09 18:08:22-05:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 #realtalk is my phrase #realtalk.
2012-03-09 05:56:19-05:00	Garret Sparks	@spovo95 You should play a couple games with @LemonheadHC with me and @NuttinbutHart. Chipotle is a part of the deal.
2012-03-09 05:53:19-05:00	Garret Sparks	@spovo95 Seriously. Unless you're in Erie.. Makes it look a lot more appealing.
2012-03-09 05:49:00-05:00	Garret Sparks	@spovo95 I can wait til I'm home. I'm used to it by now.
2012-03-09 05:45:55-05:00	Garret Sparks	@spovo95 The closest one is Toronto. Its terrible. You'd be better off going to Ann Arbor haha.
2012-03-09 05:28:46-05:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke #youreajoke.
2012-03-09 05:27:55-05:00	Garret Sparks	@spovo95 I am shocked they don't have one. I go to Leafs games just to get Chipotle. Its my life.
2012-03-08 19:49:28-05:00	Garret Sparks	@spovo95 No Chipotle in Sag? Wow that's terrible.
2012-03-08 16:52:46-05:00	Garret Sparks	@Blakes_16 apology accepted (; #loveyou.

2012-03-07 22:32:32-05:00	Garret Sparks	I have 2 nets & an open tennis court. Road hockey will be happening in the coming weeks if it stays this nice. #staytuned #bringyourfriends.
2012-03-07 16:41:08-05:00	Garret Sparks	Road hockey? #needfriends

2012-03-04 23:58:57-05:00	Garret Sparks	Erie G gets hurt and F suits up? Can't wait til a top 6 forward gets hurt and I get to take his spot on the PP. #dreamcometrue.
2012-03-04 16:36:08-05:00	Garret Sparks	@BFoote35 That awkward moment when you said you'd probably come but hit the snooze button instead..
2012-03-04 04:51:04-05:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke You have good tweets and thats why I follow you!!!

2012-03-02 03:34:46-05:00	Garret Sparks	@ginner_21 Minor details.
2012-03-02 03:31:00-05:00	Garret Sparks	@ginner_21 @BjGuelph Well at least you accept responsibility. What did peanuts ever do to you? (besides close your throat).
2012-03-02 03:23:54-05:00	Garret Sparks	@BjGuelph I blame @ginner_21. I'll settle for chocolate and coconut.
2012-03-02 03:22:47-05:00	Garret Sparks	@goaliegirl6 @Storm_city @SpencerTurcotte @ginner_21 http://t.co/vUJ1uI2K Here's the link.

2012-03-02 03:17:10-05:00	Garret Sparks	@BjGuelph I'd like a chocolate, peanut butter and coconut smoothie to be made and named after me. #ambitious #bigseller
2012-03-02 02:58:58-05:00	Garret Sparks	Been w/o FB for about 2 months now, like to consider myself a pioneer. You don't see how much time it consumes 'til you get that time back.

2012-03-01 04:55:28-05:00	Garret Sparks	@georgekouvalis ouch.
2012-03-01 04:15:06-05:00	Garret Sparks	Why can't I fish and play hockey at the same time? #iwantboth
2012-03-01 03:58:43-05:00	Garret Sparks	@Heather_Bullock Thanks, we'll need it.
2012-03-01 03:57:46-05:00	Garret Sparks	@SeanCrans let's not get ahead of ourselves.. They have two of the best young goalies in the game. Everyone has slumps.
2012-03-01 03:44:29-05:00	Garret Sparks	9 games left #crunchtime #playoffpush
2012-03-01 03:35:51-05:00	Garret Sparks	@Olden92 thanks you too.

2012-02-29 13:01:16-05:00	Garret Sparks	@C_TRAIN19 Probably because I deleted it! #lifewithouttheBook.
2012-02-29 04:17:07-05:00	Garret Sparks	8 games in 14 days starts tomorrow. By my math thats a game every day & 3/4's. Junior hockey &gt; being a student. #lovethegame
2012-02-28 15:36:21-05:00	Garret Sparks	@Marissa_Sparks The follower game isn't all its cracked up to be. #orsoihear.
2012-02-28 15:34:51-05:00	Garret Sparks	@Marissa_Sparks @stephlemke Wish she liked it half as much as you did. #oops #noresponse
2012-02-28 06:49:41-05:00	Garret Sparks	When you date @stephlemke for 26 months &gt;
2012-02-28 06:11:42-05:00	Garret Sparks	Good day for followers.. That's a bit of an understatement.
2012-02-28 01:44:25-05:00	Garret Sparks	Follow @TheK0S if you have a pulse. #humanhighlightreel

2012-02-27 19:56:27-05:00	Garret Sparks	Well I guess now its all about getting to 2K...
2012-02-27 19:54:36-05:00	Garret Sparks	"""@Tpretts: @GSparks40 in road hockey do u play out or stay in between the pipes?"" I'm a pure goal scorer."
2012-02-27 19:50:21-05:00	Garret Sparks	Well that was quick.
2012-02-27 19:49:05-05:00	Garret Sparks	@Steedorf How many guys can you assemble? And where's a good place?
2012-02-27 19:45:34-05:00	Garret Sparks	In other news, 11 more followers would give me 1,900 if my math is correct. Tell your friends.
2012-02-27 19:44:29-05:00	Garret Sparks	"""@Heather_Bullock:

2012-02-27 18:41:38-05:00	Garret Sparks	@georgekouvalis for Anson Carter...? #90sstars.
2012-02-27 18:36:33-05:00	Garret Sparks	So the consensus on the #deadline is boring. I'm sure many NHL players are thankful for that.
2012-02-27 18:33:00-05:00	Garret Sparks	@intheoradio Whew. Dodged a bullet there...
2012-02-27 18:30:59-05:00	Garret Sparks	Thanks for the rundown guys. Hopefully we see some more action soon #shakeNbake #wheelNdeal
2012-02-27 18:26:26-05:00	Garret Sparks	Haven't been able to watch #tradedeadline coverage today. Someone give me a quick update please.
2012-02-27 07:02:34-05:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke is a super awesome girlfriend. Got lucky finding her that's for sure.
2012-02-27 04:14:11-05:00	Garret Sparks	@Marissa_Sparks Maybe when I get to 2,000. #lol

2012-02-27 00:39:39-05:00	Garret Sparks	@Blakes_16 Don't be so bitter. You had a good run. Get rested for the real season. #LemonheadHC.
2012-02-26 23:51:48-05:00	Garret Sparks	As good as that win felt, it is still a bitter feeling knowing we let a 6 point weekend slip away. #playoffpush
2012-02-26 16:26:38-05:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke only I'm a guy. So its acceptable.
2012-02-26 02:31:16-05:00	Garret Sparks	@Latta17 we need some of your fire right about now #OAforthestretch #betterthantheA.
2012-02-26 02:28:01-05:00	Garret Sparks	@Latta17 I may be the most angry person in the world right now. I like your version way better.
2012-02-26 02:23:25-05:00	Garret Sparks	Win with grace, lose with grace. Another game tomorrow.

2012-02-25 05:39:44-05:00	Garret Sparks	@nastynatedawg32 Agreed. I like that move way better (;
2012-02-24 18:30:37-05:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 Guess what. You're still gonna be a rookie next year. #superschmelt.
2012-02-24 04:33:17-05:00	Garret Sparks	The most shocking part of this article is that it didn't happen at a Perkin's. #onlyinwisco http://t.co/sylyuUZ7
2012-02-24 01:14:57-05:00	Garret Sparks	We may not win every game, but I think @storm_city may have the best hair in the league. That should count for something. #pictureday
2012-02-23 17:32:00-05:00	Garret Sparks	@Tieja_Mac @georgekouvalis @ShannMRobinson ..........Welp, good luck George! #youllneedit.
2012-02-23 05:03:38-05:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 @Blakes_16 we need a portable team sound system. Ideas?
2012-02-23 01:29:48-05:00	Garret Sparks	@zles94 @Marissa_Sparks I think calls to the bench are long distance. No roaming charges though #stayput.
2012-02-22 23:14:19-05:00	Garret Sparks	My guy @georgekouvalis needs some votes for the Toronto FC dream job. Help him out please! #toogoodforusnow http://t.co/8rny2iE0

2012-02-22 07:53:12-05:00	Garret Sparks	@DSmoke1385 Thanks man. It looks way too intense. Looks like I'm gonna need to watch some youtube tutorials on virtual DJ.
2012-02-22 07:37:52-05:00	Garret Sparks	@DSmoke1385 Sounds interesting. I'll try it.
2012-02-22 07:21:15-05:00	Garret Sparks	@DSmoke1385 itd be a lot easier if I could just pause it where I wanted to insert stuff and then continue recording.
2012-02-22 07:20:35-05:00	Garret Sparks	@DSmoke1385 Yeah something for a warm up CD. And I only get three of those per song. Its terrible. Plus I have to record in one pass through
2012-02-22 07:17:00-05:00	Garret Sparks	@DSmoke1385 That's what I was using haha. I can't figure out how to get it to stutter. Any hints appreciated.
2012-02-22 06:58:50-05:00	Garret Sparks	After trying for the better part of 5 hours, I can not DJ. I will not give up, however. There's always tomorrow.

2011-09-08 02:11:27-04:00	Garret Sparks	I like when people lie to me. There is a certain amount of satisfaction in knowing you're treating someone better than they're treating you.
2011-09-08 02:06:34-04:00	Garret Sparks	Leaving my phone in Guelph for the week. #ttyn.

2011-09-06 02:05:41-04:00	Garret Sparks	Sometimes the absence of words sends the louder message. You say sorry way too much.
2011-09-06 01:15:57-04:00	Garret Sparks	@MdashFINN It's not my fault I have great form. #wavepool.
2011-09-06 01:05:54-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke but where will I be rude? #stayplease.
2011-09-05 17:03:03-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke now there's a topic worth trending. #rossi
2011-09-04 15:08:57-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Tc26Herby I'm not ass kissing, I only speak truth.

2011-09-02 20:55:38-04:00	Garret Sparks	Sad day. See ya later, @taybeckone9. You'll always be my stall mate. #welcomebackanytime #doyoulikethiskneepad?
2011-09-02 17:34:50-04:00	Garret Sparks	I could use an actual hockey game some time soon... Didn't come here to practice, I came here to win some games! #trainingcampisover.
2011-09-02 17:22:30-04:00	Garret Sparks	@BrianHuddle We'll see. I have no idea what my schedule will be like.
2011-09-01 22:52:21-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 @Eric_Schrieze SO fit.
2011-09-01 04:23:17-04:00	Garret Sparks	That awkward moment when you thought you text your girlfriend something but you actually sent it to Twitter..& failed to realize for 3 hrs.
2011-09-01 01:35:53-04:00	Garret Sparks	Still can't connect to the internet... I'm going to lose my mind.
2011-08-31 20:47:59-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jack_murphy Just like 5th grade. #unforgettable
2011-08-31 04:20:02-04:00	Garret Sparks	@erin_zuk I can't tweet and play #leaguerule. Plus I'm sure I'll have a fair amount of work this year #notimeanyways.
2011-08-31 04:19:15-04:00	Garret Sparks	@NatePhil I'll try to keep cranking them out. If you don't get the next ones though I'll be sad.

2011-08-31 00:04:31-04:00	Garret Sparks	Worst day of the season is in the books. Looking back it wasn't that bad. I'm dramatic.
2011-08-31 00:02:39-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke Whatever. #noonecares.
2011-08-31 00:02:14-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31That's pretty much my favorite has tag ever. Ps yeah tweet @stephlemke she's lonely or something like that. #needsmorefriends.

2011-08-30 04:53:16-04:00	Garret Sparks	Its just like him, to wander off in the evergreen park, slowly searching, for any sign of the one he used to love.
2011-08-30 01:58:45-04:00	Garret Sparks	Well.. I wasn't wrong for anticipating this. #socollege.
2011-08-30 01:04:58-04:00	Garret Sparks	Its nice when things begin to make sense.
2011-08-29 18:16:58-04:00	Garret Sparks	Anxiously waiting to go to practice because the rink is the only place you have friends in town. #soOHL.
2011-08-29 18:15:59-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Shick91 It's come to an abrupt end. Time to work hard again.
2011-08-29 18:00:41-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Shick91 Mine has plenty of it stored up. #letitburn.
2011-08-29 17:47:50-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ablaker26 it better. It'll have a good summer to compete with though.
2011-08-29 17:46:49-04:00	Garret Sparks	Bowl of cereal for lunch. #soOHL.
2011-08-29 14:57:18-04:00	Garret Sparks	@georgekouvalis hahahahahaha I actually was invited, no one told me what it was for/when to be there though, unfortunately. #kindaleftout.
2011-08-29 14:53:34-04:00	Garret Sparks	@georgekouvalis WHERE IS THAT!?
2011-08-29 14:52:22-04:00	Garret Sparks	And so begins that 8 month time period where I do nothing but get pucks shot at me everyday. Summer was fun while it lasted! #seeyanextyear.
2011-08-29 06:01:43-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Degroot14 where?
2011-08-29 05:51:48-04:00	Garret Sparks	I was taught to fight for the things that mean most to you. #ChipotleinGuelph
2011-08-29 05:50:54-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Degroot14 I'm a big fan of the Silver Bullet.
2011-08-29 05:50:23-04:00	Garret Sparks	@erin_zuk Woah woah woah... I never said it sucked. I'm just saying its lack of Twitter and Chipotle is a serious issue.
2011-08-29 05:48:48-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Canadiancronic I pass Pierre's on my way to Pita Pit. Gotta stay healthy. But Hockey Sushi is my winner for favorite Guelph restaurant.
2011-08-29 05:46:00-04:00	Garret Sparks	@sandpiper214 40404, but I can't see who mentions me, and that is my favorite part.
2011-08-29 05:42:51-04:00	Garret Sparks	@AndyMichols Electrical tape. It looks great if you have the patience/design.
2011-08-29 02:08:04-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 Yeah, I KNOW. Its awful.
2011-08-29 01:41:10-04:00	Garret Sparks	Not having Twitter on my phone is a hugeee let down. No Chipotle, No Twitter, Guelph is no fun! Oh except for Ribfest. #mmmribs.
2011-08-28 20:50:15-04:00	Garret Sparks	#thingsimiss list is too long.

2011-08-26 18:25:26-04:00	Garret Sparks	Western Springs, Illinois is pretty chill. They have colorful birds, fast trains, and 4 hr parking. No Chipotle though. #dealbreaker.
2011-08-26 18:11:11-04:00	Garret Sparks	Spending my last day of summer aimlessly wandering various Chicago suburbs. Alone. My friends ditched me for an education. #seeingtheworld.
2011-08-26 14:35:22-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Tyler_Biggs You should probably just come anyways.. #rulebreaker

2011-08-26 04:48:24-04:00	Garret Sparks	And as summer finally closes, I'd like to reflect and say; thanks to all for making it unforgettable and that much harder to say goodbye to.
2011-08-26 03:10:56-04:00	Garret Sparks	@mary_tolo yeah we just had a good cry session. That's fine. It's that time of the year again.
2011-08-26 00:03:46-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 still in disbelief. #welldone.

2011-08-25 20:38:44-04:00	Garret Sparks	Time to fire up Skype and shut down summer, #unfortunately. It's gonna be a long winter. The things we do for hockey.
2011-08-25 16:58:24-04:00	Garret Sparks	Momentous day: I willingly used my horn while driving. @TheK0S, @MdashFINN & @stephlemke would all be proud.
2011-08-25 16:50:37-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ablaker26 knowledge is power.

2011-08-23 18:35:01-04:00	Garret Sparks	Just spent 5 minutes sitting in my car trying to kill a fly. Embarrassing for a goalie. Persistence leads to success.

2011-08-22 02:45:50-04:00	Garret Sparks	I just don't want these to be the moments I have to remember you by and regret.

2011-08-21 23:39:52-04:00	Garret Sparks	I love learning new things, especially about things that I care about! #thirstforknowledge.
2011-08-21 22:06:46-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ablaker26 if it wasn't so last minute, you would've been there.

2011-08-21 20:43:43-04:00	Garret Sparks	Had a great day with @stephlemke @jacpresta10 and #marissadeben! Air&water show was great. Glad I got to the beach at least once this year.

2011-08-17 19:56:34-04:00	Garret Sparks	@SBurns73 I'd be okay if he scored 25-30 against me in practice next year. That's like one a week.

2011-08-14 03:55:28-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ablaker26 I could land a plane on that chicks forehead.
2011-08-14 03:42:31-04:00	Garret Sparks	@AbTheLeafFan Its not that I don't like change, I just love my home life. Wish I could have that and hockey at the same time.
2011-08-14 03:38:15-04:00	Garret Sparks	@NickCeg04 I'm at my lake, but I'll keep that offer in mind!
2011-08-14 02:13:29-04:00	Garret Sparks	@AbTheLeafFan nope, reporting for camp. Starts 8 months in Canada away from my family.
2011-08-14 01:56:03-04:00	Garret Sparks	15 days until life changes drastically, again. I'm not sure how I feel about it yet. #positives and #negatives.

2011-08-12 17:08:54-04:00	Garret Sparks	@MdashFINN in that case its probably hard to forget. #sorryitakeupsomuchspace.
2011-08-12 15:35:28-04:00	Garret Sparks	@erin_zuk if you don't take her spot she'll take yours. #onlykidding #butwatchout.
2011-08-12 15:28:43-04:00	Garret Sparks	Wondering if @MdashFINN even remembers me.
2011-08-12 15:28:25-04:00	Garret Sparks	@TheK0S sorry man.
2011-08-12 15:07:45-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 its all about just having fun.

2011-08-12 15:04:31-04:00	Garret Sparks	@erin_zuk beat her out, friendship or not. #lifeofagoalie.
2011-08-12 14:47:33-04:00	Garret Sparks	Just realized how excited I am to be playing meaningful games this season in hot new gear. #thesimplethings.
2011-08-12 14:29:45-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Dilly_Wagon I'm not saying they're better, but they are in my top 5 favorite bands for sure. Circa Survive is my #1. Need to see them live.
2011-08-12 04:57:04-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Dilly_Wagon it is a dream line up. Don't count me out. But I think Manchester Orchestra should be headlining #dontjudgeme.
2011-08-11 21:31:33-04:00	Garret Sparks	@EKirchy what are you getting? Went to 4 different dealerships before we ordered my car. Never again.
2011-08-11 21:20:42-04:00	Garret Sparks	@EKirchy how about the ones that stalk you after the fact #beprepared.
2011-08-11 21:18:56-04:00	Garret Sparks	I have spent 3 of 12 hours awake today on a bike & its not over yet. Looking for a new set of legs. Will pay good $$$. #ebay #craigslist.
2011-08-11 17:38:24-04:00	Garret Sparks	My dad designs nasty houses. #wow. Hope he comes out of retirement when I want one.
2011-08-11 16:46:39-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 I'm drawing the whole ostrich.
2011-08-11 16:43:52-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 its yours! Unless you would like a strawberry as your symbol instead.
2011-08-11 16:40:05-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 I was gonna give you a shout out on my mask, but that's hideous. Pick something else.
2011-08-11 16:33:11-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 what # are you gonna be next year?
2011-08-11 15:58:58-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 can't wait to get mine ): my mask is gonna be hot, ps.

2011-08-11 14:03:46-04:00	Garret Sparks	@mary_tolo Its okay. Ps do your parents allow it orrr are you sneaky?
2011-08-11 13:55:17-04:00	Garret Sparks	@mary_tolo jealous.
2011-08-11 13:32:33-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 I'll see which of those elements I can work in..
2011-08-11 05:52:23-04:00	Garret Sparks	Initial pirate ship concept for those who are interested. Suggestions appreciated. http://yfrog.com/h7foympj
2011-08-11 03:53:01-04:00	Garret Sparks	"Final score: Hurricane 10, Current mask 2, ""Sparks"" mask 2, & sadly, only 1 vote for COD/Angry Birds. Better get drawing.."
2011-08-11 03:51:11-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Thumaws Thanks for being the deciding vote!
2011-08-11 03:47:12-04:00	Garret Sparks	"Hurricane is running away with this one. 8-2-1 for ""Sparks themed"" and 1 for COD/Angry Birds..."
2011-08-11 03:42:06-04:00	Garret Sparks	Current mask: Hurricane mask: Would have some cool personal touches, plus be different. As it stands, 4-1 hurricane. http://t.co/wDIZcg3
2011-08-11 03:34:13-04:00	Garret Sparks	Mask ideas? Right now its between a Hurricane/Pirate themed mask or a white version of my current mask. 1st to 10 wins. #yourvotecounts.
2011-08-11 03:31:32-04:00	Garret Sparks	@hinch999 I'm just jealous of the kid's star power. One day.
2011-08-11 01:19:02-04:00	Garret Sparks	One day I will surpass Keenan Cahill as the most popular resident of Elmhurst, IL. I have a little work to do.
2011-08-10 21:55:01-04:00	Garret Sparks	@AndreaTangney tell him I'm popular!
2011-08-10 19:10:35-04:00	Garret Sparks	@aRigs33 no. #seriousanswer #backoftheline.
2011-08-10 19:10:02-04:00	Garret Sparks	Who do you have in OT, @MEmbach? Hull for Dal Stu Barnes for Buf.
2011-08-10 18:55:53-04:00	Garret Sparks	@MEmbach Gary Thorne and Bill Clement make it all worth it.
2011-08-10 17:31:07-04:00	Garret Sparks	@TheK0S can I come over for dinner every night? #lolz #straighttomyroom.
2011-08-10 17:30:14-04:00	Garret Sparks	After many great suggestions I decided on Chinese with my dad and grandpa. Can't go wrong at Red Dragon.
2011-08-10 17:00:04-04:00	Garret Sparks	What should I have for lunch? #seriousquestion.
2011-08-10 05:35:19-04:00	Garret Sparks	I'm happy with what I have, but things could always be better. Becoming satisfied means admitting a lack of desire to improve.
2011-08-10 03:51:26-04:00	Garret Sparks	Had all the elements of a great day. Just didn't pan out. #chinup.
2011-08-09 19:08:27-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Heardy15 see you in September... #maybe.
2011-08-09 03:13:49-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ablaker26 yeah me too #not.
2011-08-09 02:34:24-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 that's what happens when you tweet dumb things on top of not hanging out with us.
2011-08-09 01:33:51-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 try boys. #moreyourspeed.
2011-08-08 22:21:35-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke none of the above for your family. At least Lindsey will be safe.
2011-08-08 22:03:13-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke duhh. And getting suckered into getting donuts by a 5 year old is just part of the job. Hahaha. #suckerrr #youreweak.

2011-08-08 14:37:55-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 actually Garrett Johnson was the interested one. Aaron literally left at one point. But it was too funny. #chirpfest.
2011-08-08 14:34:39-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 what can I say.. #thatgood. But seriously they were like 14 so its fine.
2011-08-08 14:31:36-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 I think there was an Allie, a Haley, and the dog was buster. So yeah basically a success.
2011-08-08 14:28:35-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 Garrett Johnson's neighbors. They're from the 'Ville!
2011-08-08 14:25:30-04:00	Garret Sparks	"""Do you know Joey Garapolo?"" ""Yeah, we've heard of him."" Building a reputation in the 'ville. @ablaker26 @jgarp31"

2011-08-08 05:08:25-04:00	Garret Sparks	@mary_tolo it only gets worse. I'm really sorry. But I know you two can do it. #expertanalysis.

2011-08-07 12:36:50-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Canadiancronic Relapse was bad, Recovery was great because he realized he can't sing chorus'. I didn't even know he had a new album.
2011-08-07 04:03:19-04:00	Garret Sparks	Eminem is over-hyped, mainly by @britbauer23.

2011-08-06 16:11:44-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke am I still easy to miss??
2011-08-06 15:17:33-04:00	Garret Sparks	Its not even noon and I could already write a country song with the amount of things that have gone wrong today. Gotta make things better.

2011-08-02 02:54:52-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke liked the shell pic more... #justsayin'. One of those Lieberforth creeps may get the wrong idea with that pic.

2011-08-01 05:14:40-04:00	Garret Sparks	Hate when people doubt your ability to help them. Either way, good luck on your own.

2011-08-01 02:24:50-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke I'm satisfied with your grammar.
2011-08-01 02:23:14-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke I wouldn't say its been my biggest issue. I'd have to award that to deciding whether to jump or not at the waterfall.
2011-08-01 01:38:06-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke if you can't figure this one out college is going to give you fits.

2011-07-18 23:33:08-04:00	Garret Sparks	@LeafErikson Houser is a great goalie. I like Guelph and I don't forsee that being an issue. But London is a great organization.
2011-07-18 23:30:48-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke I'm overwhelmed with food choices. As long as you're there anything sounds good.

2011-07-12 02:11:28-04:00	Garret Sparks	Salvaged my night after my highly anticipated drive-in date with @stephlemke collapsed. Thanks for rescuing me, @jgarp31.
2011-07-11 22:51:50-04:00	Garret Sparks	Just ordered my new car all thanks to my dad. 2012 GMC Terrain. Couldn't be any more excited. @MdashFINN say goodbye to the box.
2011-07-11 20:41:00-04:00	Garret Sparks	@TorontoMarlies haha thanks can I get some finger paint too? And camp was amazing! Thanks for having me.
2011-07-11 20:17:11-04:00	Garret Sparks	@TorontoMarlies hey as soon as somebody pays for it, I'm on board.
2011-07-11 19:11:08-04:00	Garret Sparks	@TMLGreek thanks! I did all the artwork myself. #freehand.
2011-07-11 19:08:03-04:00	Garret Sparks	@TorontoMarlies whoever it is, he looks good.
2011-07-11 16:31:23-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke it was raining harder than the scene at the bar in the 2nd level of Inception! #greatcomparison.
2011-07-11 05:51:14-04:00	Garret Sparks	@newfiecutie1 I thoroughly enjoyed it. Not quite as good as Inception, but it made me feel fortunate for what I have.
2011-07-11 05:38:33-04:00	Garret Sparks	I prefer @stephlemke walking me out to her mom walking me out. What can you do though, she's sleepy. #sweetdreamscutie.
2011-07-11 04:46:27-04:00	Garret Sparks	And ashton kutcher would be an amazing 1st choice..
2011-07-11 04:43:31-04:00	Garret Sparks	Watching A Walk to Remember. Wow what a great flick. Mandy Moore would make a nice back up to @stephlemke #wink.
2011-07-10 18:39:34-04:00	Garret Sparks	Crab leg dinner. Thats worth getting excited about. @stephlemke #thewaitisover.

2011-07-10 06:40:04-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke #ihavenotolerance for girlfriends who fall asleep without saying goodnight.. #awks.
2011-07-09 05:48:42-04:00	Garret Sparks	@nate_herman considering those two were on the other team, locker room communication wouldn't have done much. Do I come off as quiet..?
2011-07-09 05:46:14-04:00	Garret Sparks	"@stephlemke don't say it so... Awkwardly! Of course we agree. We wouldn't be ""us"" if we didn't buddy! #loveyou."
2011-07-09 05:43:14-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke for sureee.
2011-07-09 05:27:59-04:00	Garret Sparks	Being tired is never an excuse for not giving the effort you should.
2011-07-08 18:26:18-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ablaker26 yeah I already did #confirmed.
2011-07-08 18:17:17-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 @ablaker26 That'd be super. I'm in.
2011-07-08 03:43:42-04:00	Garret Sparks	@chansler #sticktap? And thanks, i try to put some good quality saves out there every so often.
2011-07-07 23:24:39-04:00	Garret Sparks	"@stephlemke ahaaa. what a funny guy. ""He thought he was the burger king.."" #bklounge."
2011-07-07 22:54:45-04:00	Garret Sparks	@chansler woah woah woah... that was NOT me.
2011-07-07 22:52:49-04:00	Garret Sparks	@mary_tolo what's your bro doing this weekend..?
2011-07-07 19:51:53-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 @ablaker26 everybody shut up. I'm roaming and this is costing me a fortune to type. But I bet no one meets me at roller tomorrow..
2011-07-07 17:42:14-04:00	Garret Sparks	That was the best hockey I've ever played. Can't wait for next season. Final hours of camp then back to Chicago. See you soon, @stephlemke.
2011-07-06 21:21:56-04:00	Garret Sparks	@chansler upgraded to the Leafs room. #goodlife. #nomorewalking.
2011-07-06 21:02:08-04:00	Garret Sparks	Just to clarify, in prospect camp. From team white to team blue. Not literally traded.
2011-07-06 20:54:53-04:00	Garret Sparks	@DHunZzz he's still a member of team white.
2011-07-06 20:45:50-04:00	Garret Sparks	Recorded a shutout, got dealt. Whirlwind day.. #Goblue. Sorry @StuPercy5.

2011-07-03 14:20:45-04:00	Garret Sparks	@MattyC47 at least an actual person had the decency to tell me! Did you know baby cries are no match for headphones as well?? #funfacts.
2011-07-03 13:30:06-04:00	Garret Sparks	If anyone was wondering, the moving walkway is ending. Its told me about 400 times. #whoputsagatethere? #anotherhourofthis. #getmetotoronto.

2011-06-10 01:27:11-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke homework is the only reason we aren't. So sorry.
2011-06-10 00:59:42-04:00	Garret Sparks	#confession secrets are dumb. If you're not willing to share, then you probably shouldn't be doing it.

2011-06-08 14:02:47-04:00	Garret Sparks	And this empty space left in the seat, to my right where you should be, says a lot.

2011-05-30 02:58:53-04:00	Garret Sparks	@taybeckone9 you wonder why I send all these depressing  tweets...
2011-05-30 02:57:13-04:00	Garret Sparks	@rebecca3hockey the Guelph part of the trip wasn't the issue. It was the getting home. It was great to see everyone & sad to see some go.
2011-05-30 01:27:23-04:00	Garret Sparks	Nightmare trip. Cancelled flight. I didn't wanna go home anyway. Truly awful day.
2011-05-30 01:12:58-04:00	Garret Sparks	@lorrr87 Good! I may have to fill @taybeckone9 's spot as most high maintenance.
2011-05-30 01:09:20-04:00	Garret Sparks	@lorrr87 wow i kind of feel awful now.. I'm guessing shane wasn't in attendance??
2011-05-30 01:03:31-04:00	Garret Sparks	Welcome home, Mr. Cobb. Inception gets me going. Airport delays, do not.

2011-05-27 23:59:02-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke I hope I can see it tonight.
2011-05-27 16:50:06-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ablaker26 I scored a pretty one. #rookieoftheyear @jgarp31 is still in the Coast, waiting for a call-up.
2011-05-27 16:36:14-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 you're not forgotten. You need to bring a partner to the beach though. I don't like being the playmaker anymore. #goalsnoassists.
2011-05-27 14:20:29-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ablaker26 ummm before tuesday!! Let's discuss..
2011-05-27 13:58:01-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ablaker26 @ekirchy We have a good time. So i can't blame her for being jealous. I want to North Ave. Beach right meow.
2011-05-27 13:48:47-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ablaker26 @EKirchy I think she's suggesting we like boys. #falso.
2011-05-27 03:38:25-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ablaker26 I'm not on the business of getting you naked. We need a #brolliance.
2011-05-27 03:33:18-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ablaker26 operating head/tail lights? #padidleking, just checkin'.
2011-05-27 03:22:00-04:00	Garret Sparks	@AndreaTangney all wood? This is exciting.
2011-05-27 03:13:26-04:00	Garret Sparks	@AndreaTangney you bite your tongue! Those things are like gold..
2011-05-27 03:01:27-04:00	Garret Sparks	@AndreaTangney I'm flying though. I'm willing to go into additional screening for these bad boys. Should I declare them??
2011-05-27 02:49:56-04:00	Garret Sparks	@AndreaTangney I'm bringing an extra suitcase.. Hahaha.
2011-05-27 02:41:34-04:00	Garret Sparks	@AndreaTangney get my box of blades ready for my return!! Christmas part II.
2011-05-27 02:40:24-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ablaker26 [sneeze] Does it come with A/C for the beach tourney??
2011-05-26 20:52:53-04:00	Garret Sparks	I've really had enough of today, guess we'll try it again tomorrow.
2011-05-26 18:11:35-04:00	Garret Sparks	I could possibly be the most bitter person in the world.
2011-05-25 22:42:29-04:00	Garret Sparks	Happy birthday @Latta17!!
2011-05-24 05:56:03-04:00	Garret Sparks	@mary_tolo we're going to college and cannot add. #uhoh.
2011-05-24 05:52:28-04:00	Garret Sparks	@mary_tolo #theawkwardmoment when you tell someone to check their math and you're wrong.. I meant 4012 not 4021.
2011-05-24 05:51:09-04:00	Garret Sparks	@mary_tolo I know how it works. Excuse me for not wanting the world to end!!
2011-05-24 05:46:26-04:00	Garret Sparks	@mary_tolo that'd be 12/21/4021. #checkyourmath.
2011-05-23 17:54:49-04:00	Garret Sparks	Two northerns, two minutes, too easy.
2011-05-23 13:21:02-04:00	Garret Sparks	@jgarp31 @ablaker26 miss you too boys.
2011-05-23 13:20:13-04:00	Garret Sparks	There are 7 days between today and May 31st. If someone made them all disappear that'd be okay.
2011-05-23 03:52:04-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke obvs.. That's why I'm so supportive.
2011-05-23 03:44:32-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke damn straight.
2011-05-23 02:29:14-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ablaker26 I probably should. One fish all day. At least it was the biggest? 24 inches of winning.
2011-05-23 02:21:50-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ablaker26 you're a better man for it.
2011-05-23 02:18:53-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ablaker26 your #bestdayever has been going on for two days straight. That's crap, and I'm jealous.
2011-05-23 02:18:03-04:00	Garret Sparks	@Tay_mahoney teach @stephlemke how to not be afraid of them. Storms are cool.
2011-05-22 23:41:27-04:00	Garret Sparks	Should've graduated high school today.. #oops.
2011-05-22 15:10:03-04:00	Garret Sparks	I give it an hour before @jgarp31 and his date are doing the no pants dance. Time to make that kitty #purrr.
2011-05-22 04:43:26-04:00	Garret Sparks	Hoping to do more and be more tomorrow, only because its too late today. #progress, I guess!!
2011-05-22 02:59:08-04:00	Garret Sparks	Apparently specializes in shitty moods. #igiveup.
2011-05-22 02:40:51-04:00	Garret Sparks	I enjoy when days gradually improve. Until it all inevitably comes crashing down.. No news here.
2011-05-22 02:24:58-04:00	Garret Sparks	@ablaker26 was totally watching that last night. I couldn't agree more.
2011-05-22 00:20:46-04:00	Garret Sparks	Afternoon Delight on the radio in Minny. I thought this was a family station!? No fish though, #perchdontcount.

2011-04-20 13:28:10-04:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke that's why I haven't gotten a response from  @ablaker26 yet. Makes sense. #wakeandbake.

2011-04-13 18:52:37-04:00	Garret Sparks	Vacuums? No. Thunderstorms? No. Of all the things to be afraid of as a dog, mine fears hydraulics. So odd.
2011-04-13 18:01:43-04:00	Garret Sparks	Missed the noise of churchbells rolling in my open window. Good to be home.

2011-03-05 20:04:42-05:00	Garret Sparks	@mary_tolo I hear your boyfriend likes banana nut. May wanna mix some into your top.
2011-03-05 18:22:28-05:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke it certainly was. I would've felt bad calling her out for resembling baked goods though.
2011-03-05 12:41:15-05:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke thats what happens when you give up on the beach body club.

2011-03-02 17:11:22-05:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke such a tempting offer. Love going all those places with you. Why not throw a trip to FL in that mix? Me, you & no Mary. Please?
2011-03-02 16:41:09-05:00	Garret Sparks	"@mary_tolo well thats a very nice way to put it.

2011-03-02 02:44:17-05:00	Garret Sparks	@MdashFINN ... not a direct quote. But I can't say I disagree.

2011-03-01 18:17:38-05:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke I care. You spelt his name wrong. But home, smores, you and ASAP all sound like a plan to me.
2011-03-01 17:55:54-05:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke it was merely an observation. But whatever you say.
2011-03-01 17:48:41-05:00	Garret Sparks	@stephlemke Jensen Ackles is trending.. Bring me season 4!
2011-03-01 05:08:41-05:00	Garret Sparks	Just another way to talk about next years pads, @jgarp.
