@KHLguy @dynamo_ru @Capitals @ovi8 @hccska @TBLightning Agree. TB &amp; Caps is just proposal, the NHL agreed on principle. Of course, they need to agree on business side, that is the most important. As Rotenberg said a few years ago, NHL wanted around 5 million USD for a game from Russians, they refused. It must be 50/50 costs/revenues * 2021-12-10T11:55:11+00:00

@Dom_Posts @w_fink @NBHL2021 @SassyCl31698217 @Zephyr1_1967 @NHL @ovi8 See, this is typical from someone who knows NOTHING about hockey. Find your stats, screenshot them, and think you are right. God forbid actually sitting down and watching these goalies play. * 2021-11-22T22:46:44+00:00
@ahh_nuts @w_fink @NBHL2021 @SassyCl31698217 @Zephyr1_1967 @NHL @ovi8 He's better than people give him credit for. He pushed Brayden Holtby who at the time was one of the leagues best goalies out of a firm hold as starter in Washington. And I completely disagree.

At this rate, @ovi8 will score 60 goals this season. That's absurd at age 36. Nineteen games in, he's just 22 goals from passing Jaromir Jagr for third all-time. * 2021-11-22T16:23:58+00:00
@Zephyr1_1967 @NHL @ovi8 On an expansion team! I get it you are probably looking at the anomaly that is/was the Knights but if you watched that third period and saw his progressions even with crappy D he stole 2 goals from us. * 2021-11-22T05:35:13+00:00

@theetti66 @tjfloshie @K1ng_albo @PR_NHL @ovi8 @Capitals so the Russian would be chasing the guy from Quebec instead of Ontario. üòâ * 2021-11-13T20:48:04+00:00
He wears No. 8 on his back, but @ovi8 is No. 4 on the NHL‚Äôs all-time goals list.

After an impressive start to the 2021-22 season, there are now just 24 goals separating Alex Ovechkin from Jaromir Jagr (766) for third. #NHLStats: https://t.co/aKxjDY4ZWg https://t.co/nSEXVDeT6K * 2021-11-13T17:24:13+00:00

@NHL @ovi8 Right from his office. * 2021-11-13T05:35:04+00:00
@NHL @sean_kuraly Undressed one of the best D in league. There‚Äôs a reason @Capitals took advantage of an icing to get @ovi8 away from that fourth line. Was their only chance to score. @sean_kuraly is special. Does all the little things. @BlueJacketsNHL * 2021-11-13T04:23:43+00:00
Washington Capitals W Alex Ovechkin scores his 742nd career goal in a 4-3 win over Columbus to pass Brett Hull for sole possession of 4th all-time on the career goals list. He is 24 goals from tying Jaromir Jagr for 3rd at 766

@202castortroy @ChrisDayPlays1 @SpamBot3100 @leclair1995 @PR_NHL @ovi8 @Capitals Ovechkin? He can do some of that ‚Äî he's gotten better at tipping, for instance, out of necessity ‚Äî but his shot is 85% of it. He takes a cross-ice pass and bombs it, and he can hit a cigarette box from 60 feet away. * 2021-11-09T19:42:57+00:00
@ChrisDayPlays1 @202castortroy @SpamBot3100 @leclair1995 @PR_NHL @ovi8 @Capitals As you said, Crosby is one of the five or so best players in league history. But he's shown no ability to do that. And he's undoubtedly been in situations where his team needed a goal from him and he didn't score, so it's a little weird to assume he's leaving goals on the table. * 2021-11-09T19:27:10+00:00
@ChrisDayPlays1 @202castortroy @SpamBot3100 @leclair1995 @PR_NHL @ovi8 @Capitals Take the top five players in NHL history, and they're all good at different things. Like I said, Ovie has literally taken shots from the same place and beat goalies for much of his career. This is because is shot is otherworldly. * 2021-11-09T19:25:04+00:00
@farwell_ohl @SteveMcLean888 @_ChrisPope @Sportsnet @NHL @ovi8 I think an argument can be made for Ovi.  Gretzky was phenomenal, but doing it in era where 150+ points a year wasn't unusual - quite a difference  from today's NHL. * 2021-11-09T19:22:34+00:00
@farwell_ohl @SteveMcLean888 @_ChrisPope @Sportsnet @NHL @ovi8 Gotta disagree on this one. Gretz was scoring on floaters from centre ice, goalies today have bigger equipment, way less time with the puck. Definitely the best goal scorer of all time, gretz would never be able to do what he did in today‚Äôs game * 2021-11-09T18:40:23+00:00

@ChrisDayPlays1 @SpamBot3100 @leclair1995 @PR_NHL @ovi8 @Capitals Ovie's not going to saucer-pass to breaking forwards as frequently as Crosby, but Crosby couldn't stand in the same place 60 feet from the net for 10 years with a giant sign saying, "We know I'm going to shoot from here, and there's nothing you can do about it." * 2021-11-09T14:55:55+00:00
@Buccigross Who's going to doubt @ovi8 ? Greatest goal scorer of all-time, whether he makes it or not. 

It's a treat to watch him live here in DC these past few years and from a distance his career. 

The man loves to score #ALLCAPS https://t.co/lgXkk7xnml * 2021-11-09T14:22:12+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 I wish he hadn't lost so many games due to lockouts and covid. Not to mention he was only a day late from being drafted a year earlier by Florida. And they still tried to play the "leap year" angle and draft him anyway. The convo wouldn't be "if" but "when"... * 2021-11-09T10:59:31+00:00
@unfunnyjay @TheFarquaad @NHL @ovi8 That‚Äôs what seperates Ovie from the rest. He will not miss one if its not no All Star game * 2021-11-09T04:14:05+00:00

Hey @Jim_Elves  - from the 2004 draft class, 1st overall pick @ovi8 has 740 goals.  Malkin was the 2nd pick, he has 316 fewer.  Wheeler was 5th pick and is 461 goals behind Ovechkin. * 2021-11-07T21:25:29+00:00
Hmm I‚Äôd gander a guy who‚Äôs lead the league in goal scoring more seasons then any in history might argue that especially in his mid 30s and doing so. #TheGreat8. #Ovi8. From a pure goal scoring aspect even Gretzky is amazed by Ovechkin. Nobody has scored like him at that age b4. https://t.co/aqe6NTrZ9s * 2021-11-07T08:09:48+00:00
@TerryFranconia @Cristiano @TeamMessi @HKane @ovi8 @AM34 I definitely felt he had his moments where he wasn‚Äôt playing 100%, and he‚Äôs certainly not a complete player, but he is an offensive force and the one thing he does, he does better than anyone. How many goals does he have from a one-timer from the circle? And no one can stop it. * 2021-11-06T14:53:14+00:00

Fully agreed nobody will likely *ever* beat Gretzky's per Season Pts &amp; Passes stacks. It's clearly beyond today's "Goalers" efficiency.

@jwh37 @Buccigross @ovi8 And also, look at Lemieux...915 games played(nearly 300 fewer games than OV) and he only has 50ish fewer goals than OV.  Sad how Mario's health problems prevented him from breaking records. * 2021-10-26T15:28:52+00:00
@jwh37 @Buccigross @ovi8 I agree that he is, but there are other factors in eras.  The hooking, grabbing, holding were much more prevalent back in the day and they were rarely called as penalties as they are today.  Usually, things would tend to even out from era to era. * 2021-10-26T15:25:24+00:00
@tisme100 @ovi8 @TSN_Sports and @Sportsnet must receive some directive from the @NHL not to say anything when the stars f-up. You could hear the announcers cringe when the hit was made.

He's also 164 goals away from tying TNT analyst Wayne Gretzky's total. Ovechkin needs to average about 33 goals over the next five years to surpass Gretzky. * 2021-10-13T16:59:32+00:00

Come on, imagine Crosby with Ovi on his wing! I think Ovi would have broken the Gretzky goal record in 10 years, Crosby would have 3,000 pts from all the assists, and they'd each have 7 Stanley Cups to their names. https://t.co/1irNLgUedn * 2021-09-22T00:03:00+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 Only thing that can stop him from catching #99 is a career-ending injury. It‚Äôs clear he wants the record. Wouldn‚Äôt bet against him. * 2021-09-21T20:27:41+00:00

@sublime630 @SwerveCityElite @hagelin62_ @Capitals @ovi8 @penguins At 33! He is only going to continue dropping from there. All the others had their numbers etched in by the end of their careers (often at age 40). If Sid plays till 40, he‚Äôll barely be in the top 20 * 2021-09-17T01:07:44+00:00
@sublime630 @SwerveCityElite @hagelin62_ @Capitals @ovi8 @penguins I think to win games in hockey, you need to score goals or help generate them. Ovie can score from anywhere,  your words. Crosby, what‚Äôs his specialness? * 2021-09-17T01:04:26+00:00
@sublime630 @SwerveCityElite @hagelin62_ @Capitals @ovi8 @penguins Lemieux, Jagr, Yzerman, Gretzky could create assists from anywhere and rack up points. What is Crosby‚Äôs excuse for having Zero chance of being close to anyone of them in the records. At least Ovechkin can score from anywhere, justifying his goat status * 2021-09-17T01:03:14+00:00
@topazzcrapazz @SwerveCityElite @hagelin62_ @Capitals @ovi8 @penguins Then look at shot %. OV has taken about 80% more shots than Crosby. It stands to reason that he's going to have more goals. In the cap era, these guys are 1 and 2 in goals. Crosby has 2 rockets. He can score from anywhere. His shot% is 14.6. OVs is 12.8 * 2021-09-17T01:00:37+00:00

@lindacohn @NHL @evanderkane_9 @SanJoseSharks @SportsCenter @espn 1) He‚Äôs definitely one of the top power forwards in the league, so he‚Äôs a superstar in that right..nothing crazy about ss label from @lindacohn. No one‚Äôs mistaking him for @cmcdavid97 or @ovi8.

@Jeff_386 @xBraedenn @thepuckdude @Buccigross @ovi8 As a guy born in 80, who watched as much hockey as he could through the 90‚Äôs, Brett Hull gets my nod as the greatest goal scorer.

@KrisKaniac @dmddusseau @NHLNetwork @ovi8 he is like 14 away from Number 1 in power play goals. * 2021-08-16T18:05:18+00:00
@NHLNetwork @ovi8 Ovi is 33 goals back from third all time and also needs an average of 33 for the remainder of his new deal to tie Gretz. Throw in a couple 40 plus seasons and it's totally within reach. * 2021-08-16T13:28:07+00:00
@USMC03171 @NHLNetwork @ovi8 I have been watching since 95 religiously, and I couldn‚Äôt be further from your causal run of the mill hockey fan.

@monamamu @NHLNetwork @ovi8 1. WHA.  WHL is part of the CHL.

@KrisKaniac @NHLNetwork @ovi8 Has to at least be close to 50% PP goals, and like 80% of those slapshots from the point * 2021-08-15T21:30:58+00:00
@NHLNetwork @ovi8 I want to know how many were power play goals, and what percentage were slapshots from the point * 2021-08-15T21:28:12+00:00
@NHLNetwork @ovi8 If he can match his pace from last year for one more year, he will have 773 at which point he needs to average 30.3 goals for the tensing 4 years .. which could look like 40,35,30,25.. = 903 * 2021-08-15T21:14:39+00:00
@CFlo_76 @NHLNetwork @ovi8 He will need to average 33 goals over the next five years. No small feat from ages 36 to 40. Will depend when/if he hits that age wall. He rarely is hurt. Scored 51 three years ago. On pace for 54 and 43 the last two years. We'll know more come April. Hope he makes it. #RMNB * 2021-08-15T20:13:52+00:00

@Kareem0_0 @SportsCenter @ovi8 @emilymkaplan The salary cap in hockey is what keeps it competitive. Since 2002, 0 teams seeded 5-8 in the NBA have made it to the finals, whereas 1/4 of finals appearances in the NHL have been teams seeded 5-8. The NFL doesn‚Äôt have any appearances from seeds 7 or 8 either. * 2021-07-27T17:56:53+00:00
@ghosthoffa @ovi8 @NHL I would love if one of the advanced stat guys counted up exactly how many times he has scored from there in the exact same way.  I'm betting in the hundreds. It would make an awesome video supercut. * 2021-07-27T17:55:49+00:00

+3.5M for Byron or Chiarot going to Seattle or +1.85 from Kulak

Either way Habs have 3.1 or 1.5M cap space

Let‚Äôs go out here and win this game for @ovi8 @Capitals. We need a huge performance from @backstrom19 @tom_wilso @TJOshie77 and from whomever is in net tonight.

As #Caps face Varlamov &amp; NYI on LI tonight, we're reminded of recent Crew visit to Coliseum, 1/18/20. Varly was also in net for @ovi8's hat trick to pass Lemieux on all-time goal list.

@SeanWarren234 @strombone1 @RobinLehner @trevor_linden @aburr14 @ovi8 As you say within reason. I think most of us would like the straight goods from Linden on his departure from the Nux, but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be getting that anytime soon.

@TedLeonsis @ovi8 We are all blessed to have watched him grow.
The franchise with Ovie grew together, took some bumps along the way too, a lot of unfair criticism from pundits and media, but the Caps, yourself and Ovie never ≈°wayed.
You helped make greatness happen too Ted. * 2021-04-17T23:03:25+00:00

@JuveVic6 @AM34Calder @NHL @AM34 @cmcdavid97 @ovi8 @Brinksy97 Minnesota was a fringe playoff team before this year.

@SabreOfLight @BDubi17 @ovi8 Couldnt tell you the exact ones, but back then we gwnerally watched clips from places like ebaumsworld funnyjunk and ytmnd and 4chan before youtube really took off.

@joemaher @NHL @ovi8 Exactly, that‚Äôs important to point out because it makes it so much more impressive. I wish other people would realize what we are realizing... scoring 500+ from the exact same spot is crest impressive!!! * 2021-04-10T03:43:08+00:00
Did it all (so far) with one team.
Did it with goalies with more pads and bigger physical presence.
Did it despite an NHL lockout.
Continuing to do it despite two pandemic-shortened seasons.
Fewer than sixteen years from first to most recent goal tonight.
The man is insane.

@Kj_Murray1228 @DarthCavana82 @BDubi17 @ovi8 agreed. Especially with so many of his goals being one timers from the circle. He moves to be open and plays two ways. Great player, less whining. * 2021-04-09T20:01:30+00:00

@BDubi17 @ovi8 I don't know what game you watched, it must have been one, Ovi whines and crys all the time. Can only score from one place on the ice same side same circle. Sid rocks.

@deaner_10 @BDubi17 @ovi8 Ovis is a bigger &amp; heavier player. Sid did have some grounds for "whining" a bit when players had to hack at him &amp; get dirty to try &amp; stop a kid from skating circles around them and then not get penalized. It's like refs allowed players to play dirty against him to make it fair. * 2021-04-08T01:19:34+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 You sound like a little bitch! Tryna hurt feelings with ‚Äú I‚Äôd never ask for a signed stick from him‚Äù puss voice on full effect.... I like big boy better and he‚Äôs my friend. You worthless sack of shit * 2021-04-07T23:42:29+00:00
@SchwartzJay @WsxHurt @d_bart_1399 @BDubi17 @ovi8 But you will never see those guys diving and whining. That‚Äôs the only thing holding me back from Sid being a favourite player of mine. Everything else he brings in top notch. * 2021-04-07T20:20:21+00:00
@RomanBorris @d_bart_1399 @BDubi17 @ovi8 It's not just the assists though. Sid has adjusted his game every year to be the best at all aspects. Ovie has too to a degree. But, the two way play from Crosby WHILE racking up the points and accolades is what separates them. Both top 10 guys though * 2021-04-07T19:53:48+00:00
@JSNaz @ZO2_ @ovi8 @Martyman17 Hell fkin yeah and I suggest you step away from the table tennis rabbit hole before you're in too deep, that's a dangerous game to play * 2021-04-05T14:43:04+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Thanks for showing everyone what a vagina you are. I mean, Ovi has a signed stick from Sid. You just whine way too much AFTER the fact. üòÇ * 2021-04-05T02:44:12+00:00
@warrenvalewood @xrdsknFANaticx @d_bart_1399 @BDubi17 @ovi8 He‚Äôs a center. It‚Äôs literally his primary job to make plays. Ovie is a winger; his primary job is to score, not to make other people score. Again, Crosby earns points from his own goals and the four other people on the ice. Ovie‚Äôs goal count is all his. * 2021-04-05T02:17:36+00:00
@RustyShack88 @DarthCavana82 @BDubi17 @ovi8 https://t.co/qamMMSH1fA I got it from the Capitals propaganda page so if it‚Äôs not accurate it‚Äôs not on me * 2021-04-05T00:26:52+00:00
@AgoodIam @BDubi17 @ovi8 This was before my time alas; didn't come to love hockey until I met my wife in 2008.

I admit in rewatching games of the '80s as a fan from the modern era it feels so weird. Defense was hard to come by and the level of goal tending league wide was comparatively shallow imo. * 2021-04-05T00:25:52+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 I guess @BDubi17 is still hurting from the couple of right crosses Crosby planted on him

Did Crosby whine his way to all 3 cup wins?

I guess the world will never know why you didn't win any - you bitch ass wannabe * 2021-04-04T22:45:36+00:00

@DonLemoyne @ZR_dude @BDubi17 @ovi8 Thank you. Ppl forget all those concussions fuck your up. All the cheap shot he endured. Come on. Look how many games he missed do to injures from attacks from other players. Thinks where his stats would be not having missed so many games. No one would be saying shit. * 2021-04-04T16:29:50+00:00
@warrenvalewood @xrdsknFANaticx @d_bart_1399 @BDubi17 @ovi8 Again though, I didn‚Äôt say he wasn‚Äôt the best player in his team, I said that his point totals benefit from those around him. His best stats are based on other people scoring and he has had the likes of Malkin, Kessel, and many others to put him on the board. Must be nice. * 2021-04-04T16:22:41+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Lol yet arguably even worse than a Crosby whine, is a mediocre player whining about it from a keyboard. * 2021-04-04T15:14:04+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 That's always been my argument, if you switch 1 for 1 the last 16 season, no body can tell me Crosby would have won 3 cups with the Capitals.  Coming from a Capitals fan here I can say Pittsburg those years had more complete teams and goalies that got hot at the right time. * 2021-04-04T09:53:52+00:00
@deaner_10 @BDubi17 @ovi8 He doesn‚Äôt whine too much - that opinion is from people who don‚Äôt watch the games and listen to an opinion from 15 years ago or a curtain jerker like Dubo * 2021-04-04T00:32:22+00:00
@aptparika206 @BDubi17 @ovi8 Points vs goals, center vs winger, NHL Golden boy versus NHL antagonist

These two have always had different roles from every angle conceivable within the league and really should never have been compared in the first place. * 2021-04-03T23:24:33+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Big words from a guy who‚Äôs career has been absolute shit. * 2021-04-03T19:41:08+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Coming from a guy that has consistently gooned it up his whole career and has cheap shotted Crosby countless times playing against him. You are literally one of the most hated players ever like shut the hell up. * 2021-04-03T19:07:56+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Syd is the better player. Look at the assists.  Unfortunately he had a few injuries that prevented him from playing so given # of games and points differential.  Syd is better. * 2021-04-03T18:50:31+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Coming from the guy that cross checked Crosby in the back of the neck in 2015. We can check the receipts. Looolllll * 2021-04-03T16:44:52+00:00
@AlbertaBriz @BarDown @ovi8 I think he has as much swag as a garbage bag filled with dog poop from a yard that hasn't been picked up all winter. * 2021-04-03T15:21:44+00:00
@warrenvalewood @xrdsknFANaticx @d_bart_1399 @BDubi17 @ovi8 It‚Äôs almost like Crosby benefits from the team around him being better. More accurately. The team has three cups, and Crosby is on the team. It‚Äôs a team prize - not an individual one. Guys who played one single shift in the entire playoffs are also on the cup. * 2021-04-03T14:54:31+00:00

@RomanBorris @d_bart_1399 @BDubi17 @ovi8 ‚ÄòLittle bit of a scoring touch‚Äô üôÑ 

Crosby has more goals than Dubinski has career points.

Sid scores when he needs to. 

Ovie is the best pure goal scorer in 30 years, but 40% of his goals are from standing and waiting in the circle while his mates do all of the work. * 2021-04-03T14:41:32+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Most players are better than you are you even still in the NHL? Have you ever even won a single award for anything in the league or is this the only way you can get attention from the league aside from dirty cross checks to the head? Who is the whiner now? * 2021-04-03T14:16:08+00:00
@WsxHurt @d_bart_1399 @BDubi17 @ovi8 Okay.... so you‚Äôre saying what separates Ovechkin and other ppl in the league is solely the leash he gets from his coach? 

If thats what you honestly believe makes a guy average over 50g/82gms from age 19-35... you‚Äôre a waste of time üòÇ 

Move along * 2021-04-03T13:53:02+00:00

@fillwrench @DarthCavana82 @BDubi17 @ovi8 No because I actually watch every game. And again most of his goals are not slapshots. People have conflated the fact that he's very good on the left dot to suggest he only scores from there. * 2021-04-03T13:14:09+00:00
@rg_nyr @BDubi17 @ovi8 Backstrom, Oshie, Kuznetsov, Carlson, Wilson, Fedorov, just as 5 on 5 linemates. I dunno if youre trying to say Crosby has had better linemates but thats FAR from true. You're very undetvaluing Backstrom. * 2021-04-03T12:54:51+00:00

@drivenbyboredom @Jonnybeingjonny @BDubi17 @ovi8 Did you just wake up from a coma?  It has been almost ten years since you could call Crosby injury prone... * 2021-04-03T04:47:51+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Ovi is the better scorer ‚Äî arguably the best all time in that regard, but far from a complete player. Crosby is a complete player ‚Äî arguably ONE OF the best all time in that regard. These things can both exist and be true. * 2021-04-03T04:12:42+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 From all the commentary it's clearly not working out for you.  Sometimes it's best to STFU. * 2021-04-03T04:01:00+00:00

@ShaiGA_SZN @biertempfel71 @motsodu @justthe_dude @jagoffbrewer @BDubi17 @ovi8 Lol. Yes it was. Ovi took the puck from Crosby and passed to Kuzy to win the game in OT. 
Man you sure don't know a lot about hockey. It shows * 2021-04-03T03:35:31+00:00
Yeah that‚Äôs true, vast majority also doesn‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to be blind sided with a head hunting shoulder after play has passed causing us to miss pretty much a full NHL season to concussion from an @ovi8 teammate but here we are. #CBJ #LetsGoPens https://t.co/BccXpCWK3N * 2021-04-03T03:34:34+00:00
@ShaiGA_SZN @biertempfel71 @motsodu @justthe_dude @jagoffbrewer @BDubi17 @ovi8 You mean that game where Ovi stole the puck from Crosby to get the game winning assist in overtime?

Ovi still had more awards than Crosby last I checked. * 2021-04-03T03:31:16+00:00
@bucssuck4eva @BDubi17 @ovi8 Ovechkin hits, blocks shots, gets into dirty areas. Crosby does none of that. Crosby needs someone to protect him, other teams protect their stars from ovechkin. * 2021-04-03T03:13:20+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Duby, Meet me in Albany. Or I‚Äôll come to you. Let‚Äôs go. All these years of chapped ass from you over Sid is really dragging on for too long. * 2021-04-03T03:02:08+00:00
@TheSameyCharapp @BDubi17 @ovi8 None of that takes away from Sid also being the best whiner. * 2021-04-03T02:42:38+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 You are completely right! Crosby does whine to much. I've seen vids with the mics on and that's all you hear from him. * 2021-04-03T02:37:27+00:00

@markabrisley @BDubi17 @ovi8 Stanley cups is definitely not the only thing that matters. It's such a crap shoot. Look how long it took the stacked ass lightning to win a cup.

@BDubi17 @ovi8 Nice how you cut off PPG- 160 games is 2 extra seasons. Ovi isn‚Äôt even in his class. Aid does way more away from the puck to help his team win on every shift. Ovi disappears for entire games,
that has never been said about Sid * 2021-04-03T00:19:20+00:00
@KevinHussey4 @depressedcapsfn @BDubi17 @ovi8 That's one of the dumbest takes i ever heard. Anyone who has watched Ovi play knows you are a lying.  Just watch any highlight film of him and you will see 100s of goals and assists from all over. * 2021-04-03T00:11:43+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Ovi is one of the best pure goal scorers to ever play the game and that one timer from the left circle is scary great. But Sid is a much better overall player. * 2021-04-03T00:04:31+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Do we forget Crosby had years of his prime robbed from him because of injury? Ovechkin is arguably the greatest scorer to ever play the game, but Crosby is by far the better all-around player. Crosby has beena shell of what he could've been, and still became one of the best ever * 2021-04-02T23:59:10+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Everyone has their opinion of whose better Sid or ovie, but u always make it personal with Sid. U don‚Äôt like him,we get it, jealousy or whatever it is..not wanting a stick from one of the top 5 players ever kind of shows ur hate of him, ur opinion seems hate based, not on play * 2021-04-02T23:49:10+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Speaking of whining... sounds like you're a bit salty about Crosby handing your ass to you on a yearly basis. But hey, at least you got some run on Twitter to save yourself from being forgotten about for another 15 minutes * 2021-04-02T23:47:54+00:00
@CrosbyIsTheGoat @BDubi17 @ovi8 Look how many of his points came from malkin * 2021-04-02T23:36:03+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Dude you‚Äôre whining now and it‚Äôs obvious that you don‚Äôt like Sid because you hate him from your series together where you gave him a concussion by crosschecking him in the head.

Be better. * 2021-04-02T23:33:33+00:00

@Avsin191 @DarthCavana82 @BDubi17 @ovi8 From MacKinnon himself: ‚Äúbut I was worth that at the time.‚Äù That‚Äôs pretty telling that he wanted to secure a long deal based on his value at that point in his career. There was absolutely no motive of helping his team from a cap standpoint. https://t.co/EqjiwSHqlv * 2021-04-02T23:23:34+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 From an Aussie who can't skate!! Crosby has a very high hockey IQ and is always a threat, great role players around him. Ovechkin is the better leader, putting the team on his back when he needs to. Different players but both damaging. Ovi is more my type of player. * 2021-04-02T23:07:03+00:00
@BDubi17 @SethRorabaugh @ovi8 A. 15 yrs from now no one will ever remember u &amp; Sid will be in the HOF. B. Sid is one of the classiest players in the league and C. That "whining" was 15 fucking yrs ago and only because Darien Hatcher dragged him w/ his stick like a dog so i'd gripe about that too. STFU, gimbus * 2021-04-02T22:59:29+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 And we thought Crosby the first 5 or so years in the league was a whiner ... Holy shit, look at the whining from these Pens fans! * 2021-04-02T22:44:08+00:00
@StuScottBooyahs @ijames1414 @RomanBorris @d_bart_1399 @BDubi17 @ovi8 ... You kind of failed to mention how goalies can make a save and get a primary assist; and that they're 200 feet away from the goal. * 2021-04-02T22:38:01+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Sid‚Äôs been a target since he actually was a kid. Nearly two seasons lost to concussions resulting from predatory hits. If he whines or chirps a bit it maybe because taken enough shit. * 2021-04-02T22:31:29+00:00

@the_techup @RussellHamilton @Jonnybeingjonny @BDubi17 @ovi8 Apparently you've missed the fact that Ovechkin is huge, hits like a freight train and can knock guys down on his own. Crosby has literally sucker punched a guy in the nutsack from behind. He dishes out cheapshots, as well. Jesus, he cut off Marc Methots's finger with a slash. * 2021-04-02T21:34:59+00:00

@fasteronfire525 @BDubi17 @ovi8 Are you talking about Crosby from a decade ago, or Crosby now? Because in the last few years, the only "whining" he's done is pick up a 10-minute misconduct for chirping the refs, like 3 years ago or some shit. He's nowhere near as bad as he used to be when he was younger. * 2021-04-02T21:19:17+00:00

@BDubi17 @ovi8 700 of those goals are from the same spot...uncovered on the PP. Ovi is selfish player and would have won more cups if he wasn't such an individual. Sid is all around. Btw...how many cups have you won? Same as me üòÜ * 2021-04-02T20:46:00+00:00

@RJ_W27 @toddxdavis @BDubi17 @ovi8 Crosby has made some remarkable passes not everyone can make. Most of the time the people scoring from those passes, are doing so on an open net. The tap in goal was the hard part, right?  FOH * 2021-04-02T19:53:46+00:00

@BDubi17 @ovi8 Sid better than you? No comparison. Your most fame is from being an irritant to him in playoffs, which u had to do b/c Sid is a 200‚Äô player who is more than just a goal scorer.

@KoeberB @BDubi17 @ovi8 Bro everyone bitches to the refs. This came from that fat sloptard Ken Hitchcock when Crosby got his teeth busted out with no call. Anyone that actually watches the Pens knows he hardly ever complains to the refs * 2021-04-02T19:19:05+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Eff right off bud. If I want to hear any professional comments on Sid vs. Ovi I'd want to hear it from someone way more relevant than you. Both Sid and Ovi are all time greats, you're an all time trash bag. * 2021-04-02T19:16:53+00:00
@KoeberB @BDubi17 @ovi8 I‚Äôd agree if he used the stats from those years. But he went all the way to present 2021 well after Crosby got out of that habit. * 2021-04-02T19:09:44+00:00

@zachdoran_10 @BDubi17 @ovi8 I‚Äôve played and reffed, you can absolutely get refs to call more penalties (for or against you) if you complain enough. I‚Äôm not saying Ovi doesn‚Äôt dive or complain. I‚Äôm saying that you can find more instances of Crosby doing it. I will note that a lot are from his early years * 2021-04-02T19:03:18+00:00
@Gary4z @BDubi17 @ovi8 The year they won he did and the last few years he has.

@d_bart_1399 @BDubi17 @ovi8 Also as a guy that played against both these players for their whole career and in the division for a lot of it, I think he has some credibility and right to speak on how they act during games (whining etc) more than you or I do. 

Sid spent a lot of time crying from age 18-25. * 2021-04-02T18:28:35+00:00
@KevinHussey4 @depressedcapsfn @BDubi17 @ovi8 If you seriously think Ovechkin simply stands at the dot you don't know anything about hockey. Ovechkin's goal chart is all over the place, he scores from everywhere and he didn't even move to the left dot on the PP until after he'd won 2 MVPs and had a 65 goal season. * 2021-04-02T18:26:24+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Ovi is one of the best pure goal scorers EVER!!....Sid is one of ‚ÄúTHE‚Äù best EVER...there is a difference...poll every NHL GM and 9 out of 10 (at least) would chose Sid to start their franchise...now take the 2 mins of attention you wanted from this and move along * 2021-04-02T18:23:08+00:00
@xrdsknFANaticx @d_bart_1399 @BDubi17 @ovi8 This is the right answer. Ovi‚Äôs point totals derive mostly from him scoring the goals himself. Crosby‚Äôs derive from all five people on the ice scoring the goals. Much easier to rack up points when the entire team is earning then for you. * 2021-04-02T18:23:01+00:00
@depressedcapsfn @BDubi17 @ovi8 ‚ÄúTeams around him didn‚Äôt collapse‚Äù? You mean if Crosby and company didn‚Äôt oust them time and again from the playoffs like a bag of garbage into the dumpster. * 2021-04-02T18:08:55+00:00
@Literacy_Phil @MarkMaddenX @ovi8 What that Sids had better players to lean on, better staffs and offices? Better structure? Ovi was asked to carry more from the jump. Yall overvalue Crosby to a strange degree. I even believe Sid is alltime... * 2021-04-02T17:59:25+00:00

@Steve_Byra @BDubi17 @ovi8 If I had that many powerplay goals from the circle in my career and that lethal of a slapshot- yes * 2021-04-02T17:36:59+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Bro you said fuck sid, and you also said you would never want a stick from him. You‚Äôre foolish. ‚ÄúBc Sid whined‚Äù Ovi screams at the refs every time. Drop that narrative. Sid whined when he was young, but every player does. Y‚Äôall just use that to try and deflect from his greatness. * 2021-04-02T17:36:01+00:00
@Kj_Murray1228 @DarthCavana82 @BDubi17 @ovi8 I think what he is trying to say is that ovechkin should be passing it to oshie instead of clapping 1Ts from the circle. Because the object of the game is to pass to as many people as you can * 2021-04-02T17:32:29+00:00

@BDubi17 @ovi8 Pretty sure from my math looking at it Crosby has more PPG with assist being in there.i mean, 6 points less with 164 games seems pretty huge. Also, can't see it well but the +/- looks to be in favor of Crosby by a fair amount meaning his lines are better at defending and scoring. * 2021-04-02T17:02:35+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Man you‚Äôve gotta be kidding with the follow up as well, maybe you could‚Äôve been as good as them if you had some hockey IQ. Crosby is a better hockey player than ovi that‚Äôs pretty much a fact, not to take away from ovi but sid is a 100% player ovi not so much luv u ovi * 2021-04-02T16:50:17+00:00
@Larry_Byerly @thecodyjthomas @BDubi17 @ovi8 not sure where that comes from but the math says thats wrong.

Mario: 1,723/915 = 1.88
Wayne: 2,857/1,487 = 1.92

Maybe that counts playoffs? * 2021-04-02T16:48:07+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 And here you are still trying to keep yourself relevant by coming after Crosby. Dude whined because he had thug dusters like you cross checking him and tackling him away from the puck. And Crosby is better THAN you. Apparently grammar isn‚Äôt your strong point either. * 2021-04-02T16:36:00+00:00
@domaug @BDubi17 @ovi8 Sure, hon. No one is as smart as you and no one is allowed to disagree. Now you go enjoy your logical fallacies over there, far away from me, thanks. * 2021-04-02T16:31:38+00:00
@thecodyjthomas @Jonnybeingjonny @BDubi17 @ovi8 Brain injuries from illegal hits dont count the same as suspensions. Ovi‚Äôs been suspended 9 games by my count, plus several game misconducts. The real question is who‚Äôs DECIDING to make themselves unavailable to their team? Dubi can think what he wants. Just arguing this 1 point * 2021-04-02T16:30:39+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Crosby whined while Ovi plays reckless a lot of times. Don't all players "whine"? What is the definition of "whining" from the "Crosby sucks" crowd? * 2021-04-02T16:29:45+00:00
@fasteronfire525 @BDubi17 @ovi8 considering you think Crosby is a whiner in 2021, there's no way you actually paid attention to any hockey outside of Capitals garbage. all you literally know about Crosby is whiner memes from 2008. * 2021-04-02T16:23:03+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Assists=Goals maybe you took to many blows to the dome from Sid. Take a lap. * 2021-04-02T16:19:04+00:00
@dontmaatta @DickRhaliwal @Jonnybeingjonny @thecodyjthomas @BDubi17 @ovi8 LOL ok. I cant think of one goal from Crosby youd find on an all time hockey goal video. Can think about 5 from Ovi. But sure, go off. * 2021-04-02T16:17:49+00:00
@kgleas04 @BDubi17 @ovi8 He is far from the better player.. enjoy the 3-D glasses https://t.co/FhzVHmV5ln * 2021-04-02T16:15:35+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Also Crosby is not a whiny player anymore and has majorly cleaned that up from his game * 2021-04-02T16:10:09+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 appreciate your opinion from an nhl'r too. Sid was a whiner and Ovi a bit of a me first guy but both matured into Winners and HOF players and guys loved by team mates. * 2021-04-02T16:07:12+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 From a Caps fan I can admit Crosby is the better player and he‚Äôs proven that through his hardware (Ovi would be a little closer if the teams around him wouldn‚Äôt collapse in the big moments), But Ovi has 724 Goals and is in the head of every goalie in the leagueü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è * 2021-04-02T16:06:33+00:00
@CrAmidoneous @BDubi17 @ovi8 Oh I was tagging you from the perspective of our old Ranger faithful who battled Crosby with all he had during the prime years, still doing dirty work in the corners (of the internet) * 2021-04-02T16:00:46+00:00
@BDubi17 @ovi8 Whiny bitch desperate for attention comments from Brandon Dubinsky... so shocking * 2021-04-02T15:57:50+00:00
@thecodyjthomas @Jonnybeingjonny @BDubi17 @ovi8 Most of those games came from his concussion/misdiagnosed neck injury. He's been pretty durable besides that. * 2021-04-02T15:57:05+00:00

@NHL @ovi8 Great call from @JoeBpXp. And to everyone wondering why teams continue to ‚Äúlet‚Äù them do this or why it can‚Äôt be coached, it‚Äôs not just coaching, it‚Äôs talent based. There‚Äôs a reason this dude is the greatest current goal scorer. * 2021-03-27T19:21:15+00:00
@CedCp3 @NHL @ovi8 If he's got the "best offensive skill set in the game" that's pretty inconsistent. And the #1 pick from his draft year has a Hart trophy, so not exactly a bad choice either. Love Kuzy; am Caps fan, but don't think being Russian held him down. Tarasenko was drafted ahead of him. * 2021-03-27T19:17:23+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 @Capitals Ovi missed a season &amp; a half because of lock outs... &amp; almost a full season due to Covid. He very well could‚Äôve already been a sliver away from breaking the record, but due to circumstances outside of his control, he‚Äôs still chasing The Great One‚Äôs record... like a rockstar!

@NHL @ovi8 @Capitals Whether or not he does, one thing is for sure...  Ovechkin has made his mark on the NHL and many fan lives during his tenure...  He still has life in him so this is far from over!  #ALLCAPS #Ovechkin #ILoveThisSport * 2021-03-21T03:17:24+00:00
@Jason_Liq @NHL @ovi8 @Capitals Lol. And that was their 3rd string goalie to start the season. 

Rangers D too scared and weak to push Ovie away from crease. * 2021-03-20T18:13:14+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 @Capitals These two goals remind me of the Islanders broadcast duo implying he doesn‚Äôt work for goals.  Not surprising coming from division opponents though. * 2021-03-20T13:48:08+00:00

@moderndayjesse @NHL @ovi8 @Capitals He‚Äôs missed almost half an entire season to COVID too.  He feeds off the energy and always has so I‚Äôd expect a surge from him with fans in the building.  We saw it in Philly. * 2021-03-19T00:16:24+00:00
@Iliketheyankees @NHL @ovi8 @Capitals I'm well aware but that was not the point. He played in a lower scoring era and still is up there among the top 20 where no one else from his era is * 2021-03-18T19:55:54+00:00

@ratedm4mark @NHL @ovi8 @Capitals It's the  go to spot on most power plays in hockey as you probably know. Good puck movement will always open up that spot. He just happens to be one of the greatest shooters of all time. And I will take that bet, 45%. No way 323 goals came from just there. * 2021-03-18T02:21:29+00:00

GREAT goal by @ovi8. #ALLCAPS will need to keep up the goal scoring to make up for shit goaltending from Samsonov. Flyers are good for at least 3-4 more goals at this rate. * 2021-03-14T01:27:53+00:00

@ovi8 apparently Ovechkin thinks it‚Äôs Carlo‚Äôs fault for taking a head shot from Wilson. Gotta know who is on the ice according to him. I guess he knew Fr√©d√©ric was on the ice when he speared him in the groin @nhl #ospearskin * 2021-03-08T07:27:03+00:00

@marcthiessen @ovi8 I assume you‚Äôre joking. Ovi and Vlad are so tight that they have sleepovers.

Another #Caps note - the hustle and play from end to end on defense by @ovi8 had some similarities to the greatest individual play I've seen him make -- In person, in Vegas -- Game 5 of #StanleyCup Final....broke up a breakaway to preserve a one goal deficit. @Capitals tied it up * 2021-02-17T02:25:26+00:00
IMO this is why you‚Äôll never b able 2 compare McDavid, Matthews, etc to legends from this era. Totally different game back then.

@Capitals fans it was 3rd loss in a row to Philly 7-4. The D just wasn‚Äôt there again.

Overall: High scoring games are always entertaining to watch as long as you‚Äôre on the winning side.

@Capitals fans we are headed in the wrong direction with a 4-2 loss to NYR. Goals from @CarlHagelin and @ovi8. Not sure what‚Äôs going on but the D was loose and we love to be in the sin bin. Still think it‚Äôs due to a lack of training camp. We will get this. https://t.co/Ei4kUUoe1X * 2021-02-05T07:05:19+00:00
@TheSunWillSh1ne @ash1ees @NHL @ovi8 Ovechkin is awesome no doubt from me * 2021-02-05T04:09:36+00:00
Was about to quip that this #WSHvsNYR game is like eating a sausage after getting out of the tub in Munich.  It's going from Bad to Wurst.

And then @ovi8 did what he does.  #ALLCAPS * 2021-02-05T02:23:45+00:00

One of my favourite things from last night...

Ovechkin crushed into the glass in the celebration, nobody on the outside can get near Ovi, but Big Z can just reach over, hit him on the head and have a conversation above all of the bodies üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è @ovi8 #ALLCAPS https://t.co/G16AxQv59x * 2021-01-31T15:08:00+00:00
#Caps 4, #Bruins 3 (OT): @ovi8 marks his return from contact tracing absence by scoring OT winner and tying Mike Gartner for seventh in NHL annals with 708 goals. @CMcAvoy44 tied it with :58 left. Chara, for WAS?, played 20:54, had one shot and blocked six. * 2021-01-31T15:08:00+00:00
@GregGoth @SabreHess @Onthewarpathbuf @NHL @ovi8 @cmcdavid97 Ah, the https://t.co/iT9BF5mUl8 article was #1 Draft Picks from earlier. I can see the diferrentiation from there.

Point still stands from OT winners and there is a criterion Eichel didn't meet and no use thrusting him in the discussion. * 2021-01-31T14:54:45+00:00
@SabreHess @Onthewarpathbuf @NHL @ovi8 @cmcdavid97 Because it‚Äôs a dumb thing to be mad about from the start * 2021-01-31T14:15:23+00:00
How do you know that game winner from @ovi8 was unreal? Replay shows Assistant coach Kevin McCarthy, who has only seen Ovie for a few games yell WOW! You could tell even with the mask. * 2021-01-31T02:45:08+00:00

What the coach of the @BlueJacketsNHL team did on Thursday night, if I‚Äôm right, sound right to do it during a hockey game. * 2021-01-23T15:35:00+00:00

@Capitals @ovi8 Chara Carlson combo!! They won‚Äôt need a goalie! Samsonov will step up huge, and Kuznetsov wil be unstoppable. Ovi, I‚Äôve loved you from the start. (However, I had to sell your ‚Äúcup rookie card way too early to pay for my kids sports and now have a sick feeling in every morning)üòû * 2021-01-05T11:17:27+00:00

Somewhere, deep down, I always knew it would be a global pandemic that kept @ovi8 from reaching Gretzky‚Äôs record @Capitals @russianmachine * 2020-12-22T01:49:25+00:00
@CompetielloBob @ovi8 Dude - you're losing me here. And I am super open. And I would never take anything away from any athlete that has pursued and won their respective championship. But a "hot goalie" is too simple and just one part. * 2020-12-20T18:41:50+00:00
@avappleyard @NHL Could also be what prevents @ovi8 from catching @WayneGretzky * 2020-12-20T15:47:06+00:00

@liam_mchugh My pick is @ovi8 . I was an Atlanta Thrashers season ticket holder from 03-10 and he was one of the most electrifying athletes I ever saw. We had Ilya #kovalchuk in his prime and those two would always elevate their game against each other. * 2020-11-30T00:40:27+00:00

@BdonMack @MarkMaddenX @ovi8 COVID and that lockout of 2013 too. It‚Äôs not a whole season but the goals add up. I‚Äôd say Jagr has the record if there‚Äôs no lockouts in 94 and 04, and he doesn‚Äôt leave for 3 years from 08-11 * 2020-11-25T14:42:34+00:00

@Tbog12 @ovi8 It is! he was a biter when I first got him when he was a baby so I kept trying to find stuff to help stop that and those are made from a special wood-type material made for him to chew on and it helped :) he liked sleeping on them too tho haha.

@justaspoon16 @emmsee61 @OTCeIIy @EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 @cmcdavid97 True we should judge everything by the for fun skills competition at the all star game from 3 years ago * 2020-10-06T05:07:51+00:00
What a 15 years it has been:
706 goals (+65 in playoffs), 2668 hits, 9 Rocket Richards, 1 Calder Trophy, 1 Art Ross Trophy, 3 Hart Memorial Trophies, 3 Ted Lindsay Awards, 1 Conn Smythe, and Washington‚Äôs first ever #StanleyCup. Thank you @ovi8 for a great 15 years from #ALLCAPS https://t.co/AhEZRAOvME * 2020-10-06T00:21:25+00:00
@TheBlueNWhite @mathewjdp @EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 @cmcdavid97 I wasn‚Äôt talking about his gap. I‚Äôm talking about how far away he is from a league leader * 2020-10-05T19:55:18+00:00
@Hockey_Expert_ @mathewjdp @EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 @cmcdavid97 Huh? I‚Äôve seen a lot of writers and fans from other teams saying Mackinnon should have won it. He‚Äôs a better player second only to Mcdavid * 2020-10-05T19:44:37+00:00
@TheBlueNWhite @Hockey_Expert_ @EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 @cmcdavid97 He is a center....

I dont disagree but lets talk about 2 years from now 2 years from now * 2020-10-05T16:12:26+00:00
@Hornyqvist7272 @EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 I'm pretty sure these are basically the same ratings from NHL 20. Talk about phoning it in. Whoever does the ratings for the game should actually watch some hockey. * 2020-10-05T00:39:49+00:00
@J_Mills_5 @jplumpton1 @EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 @cmcdavid97 That‚Äôs true from time to time but over a full season it would average out * 2020-10-04T17:35:24+00:00
@TJHaskell88 @EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 Just cause he scores a lot of goals, doesnt mean he has a good slap shot, it's above average for sure, but it isn't an elite level, also, I watch the leafs from time to time with friends/family so I see him play and he mostly scores on wrist shots or snap shots * 2020-10-04T16:58:15+00:00
@BoltsJolts @EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 When does anybody use a clapper anymore? Aside from Shea Webber * 2020-10-04T14:03:59+00:00
@mitchharley1 @EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 Rarely used the clapper but yeah his shot is lethal. I do remember one from the point on as power play * 2020-10-04T04:47:43+00:00
@ovi8 @EASPORTSNHL EA please do this with FIFA International Soccer from Sega Genesis. * 2020-10-04T02:29:37+00:00
@G20YT @BeatenMonkey @EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 @cmcdavid97 ..and it‚Äôll result in the puck having higher negative acceleration coming from the crossbar than the netting. The fact that you need to explain this with some logic to you shows a lot. * 2020-10-03T23:44:59+00:00
@EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 Why are all but two of these forwards when defensemen take more slap shots from the point? * 2020-10-03T21:42:47+00:00
@Lafllamme @MegaNuck @EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 Correct me if wrong but don‚Äôt they get to start from further out in the AHL slap shot contest * 2020-10-03T20:24:49+00:00
@EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 @cmcdavid97 Lol EA. Does anyone at the company watch hockey? No Matthews?? This is from a buffalo fan. * 2020-10-03T17:53:36+00:00
@EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 Ummmm the guy with 48 goals who scores slappers from the same spot as Ovi? To have Pastrnak 9th and then absent all together is a joke * 2020-10-03T17:29:08+00:00
@EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 @cmcdavid97 How about the man with the best goals per game average from 19-20, Mika Zibanejad? * 2020-10-03T17:05:38+00:00

@trojanvoice @jmacyourlife @ovi8 @EASPORTSNHL @EASPORTS @EA Yes, exactly, sure they had an excuse a decade ago, but we are in 2020, and that excuse isn't stopping Madden or FIFA from being on PC. * 2020-10-02T18:58:02+00:00
@Margefro87 @ovi8 @EASPORTSNHL They need a algorithm to block these names from jump street.  People have continually been reported, yet the problem persists. Lifetime bans for 1 offense is how they solve it * 2020-10-02T17:10:00+00:00
@ovi8 @EASPORTSNHL They just removed Jeremy Roenick‚Äôs name from his build and put your name on it * 2020-10-02T17:06:50+00:00
@jmacyourlife @ovi8 @EASPORTSNHL Lemme ask you. You play on this PC in 3440x1440 resolution, 21:9 ultrawide, in a high refresh rate. With the hardware ti support it.

@DaveHammer14 @Capitals @EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 Have you seen him score a goal. A lot of them come from one spot off offensive zone possessions. Incredible. Everyone in rink knows it‚Äôs coming from that spot and it still goes in more often then not lol. * 2020-08-25T03:04:51+00:00

@justa_scumbag @EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 People like you make us CO sports fans look terrible. Please refrain from tweeting again. * 2020-08-24T16:45:01+00:00
@EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 wow baltimore is getting all the love from EA this year * 2020-08-24T16:12:26+00:00
@xTechHockey @HermanOfTheYear @DontBeSaad20 @EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 Love ya Brent and I get you have friends at EA, but you gotta see they had months before COVID alone and years to re-implement an already existed and hugely missed/requested feature that they had before so wouldn‚Äôt even have to start from scratch. They‚Äôre honestly just too cheap. * 2020-08-24T15:34:07+00:00
@xTechHockey @HermanOfTheYear @DontBeSaad20 @EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 The counter to this is that we were told no features were lost because of the epidemic. That means it wasn't in the works from the start.

It is truly a must-have for '22. * 2020-08-24T15:27:33+00:00
@xTechHockey @HermanOfTheYear @DontBeSaad20 @EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 This game should have been in the work since the last game was out. No reason not to have it. Last years game (NHL 20) was likely finished around August. That being said you had from August to February. 7 months. Give or take 2 or three for the benefit to EA. * 2020-08-24T15:27:10+00:00
@ColtonHunter17 @MattCullen__ @EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 yeah, but it doesn't deserve the reaction I've seen from some people, PLD is a good player, strong defensively, and when columbus decides to fucking score, he's usually there. * 2020-08-24T15:19:28+00:00
@EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 It‚Äôs cute ea hires the kid from grade 8 just learning photoshop to make this!!! You just made little Jimmy‚Äôs dream‚Äôs come true! * 2020-08-24T15:17:13+00:00
@Milestd86 @MattCullen__ @EASPORTSNHL @ovi8 sadly true, from a financial point it's better to market players from bigger and more weep seen market, something columbus is not. * 2020-08-24T15:13:34+00:00
@coachv014 @TimHortons @NHL @Senators @EdmontonOilers @NHLJets @NHLFlames @Canucks @Mackinnon9 @ovi8 Oh for sure, the 'Hon' üá®üá¶ thing was more from speculation on why these 6.

I guess if it could only be 6, better to choose random teams than all Canadian teams and leave one out.

I personally would have much preferred to have a player from all 7 teams. * 2020-08-24T01:03:40+00:00
@momma182 @TimHortons @NHL @Senators @EdmontonOilers @NHLJets @NHLFlames @Canucks @Mackinnon9 @ovi8 And while I respect each of the players represented, for fans of other teams, especially of Canadian teams given where the largest percentage of Tim‚Äôs revenues come from, it would have been nice to have had those markets represented! * 2020-08-23T20:14:42+00:00
@ovi8 @ovi8 hey Ovi.... We just got 'your' shirt framed! My boy is a HUGE Ovi fan and we came to see you all the way from London when you played Panthers last year in Miami.... Amazing experience! A shout out for Zac would make his year!
Stay safe, best wishes.... https://t.co/e5h2Uj6gzk * 2020-08-23T14:20:16+00:00
@mtlfifteen Hockey was not part of my family or upbringing at all. But I moved from Brooklyn NY to BFE Michigan where people hated me because I was from NY and it was when the Isle were hay day. Not my team but it got me through rough day‚Äôs then @ovi8 the rest is history * 2020-08-23T03:19:41+00:00

@Haze803 @Tre_Hayes9 @NHL @ovi8 Right? Like how can anyone deny Ovechkin‚Äôs claim to the greatest ever goal scorer moniker at this point? It‚Äôs all there from the Rockets, to the longevity, to how prolific he‚Äôs been during his career and his peak. The 65 goal season is one of the 3 greatest ever adjusted. * 2020-08-19T16:09:55+00:00
@TimDamage @nnorowski @DaDanJohnsenSho @Tre_Hayes9 @NHL @ovi8 At least and this was during his goal scoring prime, Gretzky endures a lockout sure but he was washed up as a goal scorer by then. Not to mention Ovechkin was robbed of the 50 goal mark record this year from COVID. Conservatively, Ovechkin should have 100 more goals on his total * 2020-08-19T16:08:51+00:00
Alex Ovechkin (@ovi8) doesn't JUST score goals. Look at the defense from the captain. #StanleyCup https://t.co/Io7rXDFbKe * 2020-08-19T15:05:22+00:00

@KNVBCMNT @jghetz @SRC9596 @NHL_Watcher @Scarchelli @NHL @ovi8 @Capitals Good point, but Cloutier has been working with Ian Clark long before he moved to CBJ. Thats my bad for not including Clouts. Easy to say cloutier learned a thing or two from Clark? And that Hes also a good goalie coach? * 2020-08-19T06:56:36+00:00
@KNVBCMNT @jghetz @SRC9596 @NHL_Watcher @Scarchelli @NHL @ovi8 @Capitals To note, Markstrom is arguably a worse goalie when traded to us from Florida. Ian Clarke is a hell of a coach and can turn goalies into good ones.

The fact that Eddie Lack can be a decent starting goalie is a funny accomplishment for Clarke. 

Luongo, Schneider, Miller etc. * 2020-08-19T06:45:45+00:00
@breezy31748497 @jghetz @SRC9596 @NHL_Watcher @Scarchelli @NHL @ovi8 @Capitals Keep a good goaltender. Plus, hate to say it, but aside from Hughes, that blue line is üóë with no real good B-level guys even in the pipe and no way to address that at the draft. * 2020-08-19T06:21:11+00:00
@KNVBCMNT @jghetz @SRC9596 @NHL_Watcher @Scarchelli @NHL @ovi8 @Capitals Just as a fan from somewhere else would say, but Thatcher Demko is there. Now, hes not a superb goalie that markstrom turned out to be, but he will be. Demko showed that this season when marky was hurt. * 2020-08-19T06:20:33+00:00
@KNVBCMNT @jghetz @SRC9596 @NHL_Watcher @Scarchelli @NHL @ovi8 @Capitals I agree with you. We had our chance from 2009-2012 but there were other teams that had more heart and soul. It does make me sad but at the end of the day, Sedins are World Champions and Olympic Gold medalist, happy for them. * 2020-08-19T05:46:05+00:00
That‚Äôs exactly what we needed from the @Capitals in the 2nd and 3rd!!  Now we need to go 1-0 on Thursday. Let‚Äôs go boys!! #ALLCAPS @ovi8 has an ability to will the team to win, until they engage. Great game from Dillon too, best D on the ice. üëèüëèüëè * 2020-08-19T02:50:44+00:00
@ovi8 Is the best leader in the NHL. What a performance from the Caps! Russian machine never break. * 2020-08-19T02:47:00+00:00
The @Capitals survive and take game four #AllCaps 3-2 vs the @NYIslanders with 2 from @ovi8 The series is now 3-1 for in favour of #Isles * 2020-08-19T02:42:46+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 @NHLonNBCSports @Sportsnet I think teams need to start taking a page out of soccer‚Äôs book when Ovi is on the ice. Solid system, just shut him down with the 3 man wall and cut off the OT pass from carlson https://t.co/pVcbZ2pWSM * 2020-08-19T02:32:39+00:00

The @Capitals get two goals from @ovi8, but fall to the @NYIslanders, 5-2. Third period has been the killer in this series...New York has out-scored Washington 5-0. Caps must win 4 of 5 now to avoid first-round exit. * 2020-08-15T02:51:19+00:00

@kian_loveday @NHL @ovi8 @NHLdotcom Not hating on him. He's going to go down as probably the best goal scorer ever and was especially dominant in his prime.  

However, he just doesn't have a good impact on defense.  Here is him from 2015-18 at 5v5.  Like a better Phil Kessel (forward with good O and bad D) https://t.co/dtLTv4F4tj * 2020-07-10T01:15:36+00:00

@goaltending3131 @chigurrh @NHL @ovi8 @NHLdotcom Panarin being a better overall player is a laugh. Theres a reason his teams consistently choke in the playoffs. Because he can't take a hit, which is why the hawks dumped him. Ovie will always bring the physical game in the playoffs. Far from one dimensional. * 2020-07-09T18:58:37+00:00
@chigurrh @NHL @ovi8 @NHLdotcom He hasn‚Äôt declined this year, buddy, there‚Äôs zero correlation to back this up. The team fell off a cliff mid December and was a .500 team until corona hit. The few wins they were accruing could often be attributed solely to him snatching victory from defeat. * 2020-07-09T18:12:58+00:00
@BLBlueShirts26 @NHLonNBCSports @Capitals @penguins @NHLBruins @AM34 @ovi8 @pastrnak96 our defense is severely underrated as in Pelech and Pulock are dangerous together pelech is a top 10 shutdown defenseman in the nhl and you probably don‚Äôt even know his name and Pulock is our #1 d-man his shot goes 100 mphs and he dangerous from the ovi spot * 2020-07-09T17:47:25+00:00
@goaltending3131 @NHL @ovi8 @NHLdotcom No, it's not bad. But it should stop him from being anywhere near consideration for the best LW right now.  Didn't even average a point per game. * 2020-07-09T17:21:12+00:00

@NHL  one lousy thing about ending season early is players like @cmcdavid97 miss out on milestones. @ovi8 would‚Äôve had 50 goals again but stuck at 48. I believe McDavid would‚Äôve been first plyr w/4 straight 100 pt seasons since Yzerman from 90-93. * 2020-07-01T13:29:25+00:00

@BMXStr8nger @NHL @ovi8 20 years removed from their respective careers ending and most will likely have Ovechkin above. His individual resume is pretty superior. More MVPs, more trophies, more accomplishments. Team trophies definitely matter but overrated. Regardless they‚Äôre both top 10 all time * 2020-06-28T15:39:04+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 Really missed a chance to put a pun in your tweet. ‚Äúall-time gr8s‚Äù.

The Canes rallied and played the best period of hockey I‚Äôve seen in a long time. The memories that were taken from that game didn‚Äôt just belong to my husband. They belonged to hockey fans and non fans. * 2020-05-30T13:57:37+00:00
@Digital_Pigeon @FraserJYoung @NHL @ovi8 @pastrnak96 @tuukkarask @Bridgestone I suggest that you are guessing as I havent found anything from the NHL...but if so, that sucks! These are real games with obvious consequences. Sure hope the committee who chooses the NHL Awards has already chosen because if scoring doesnt matter, nor should any of their play. * 2020-05-28T22:35:07+00:00

@Capitals @ovi8 Awesome! He was robbed from 50 goals again. It‚Äôs just getting really unfair at this point * 2020-05-27T15:42:10+00:00

@mrshulman @russianmachine @ovi8 I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that much of a hit. I‚Äôd think he‚Äôd have 10 more goals maybe 15 at most by the end of the season. If he is 10 or 15 goals away from Gretzky‚Äôs record by the end of a season, he‚Äôd come back that next season * 2020-05-26T21:54:05+00:00

@reporterchris Maybe just start the FY20 - FY21 regular season early and make it supersized? 

Some of us have an imploding team and our only joy comes from @ovi8 chasing Gretzky's record. It's one thing to get bounced after another 50+ goals, another in a forced shortened season's playoffs. * 2020-05-22T02:52:57+00:00
@salimvalji @jpakey99 @cassieloves1013 @BradyTom89 @cmcdavid97 @TimHortons @ovi8 Crosby is my favorite, but I agree, a few words from him could help so much and he‚Äôs not doing that. * 2020-05-19T21:26:47+00:00

@AndyPicarro @CRamirezCalif @ovi8 @penguins @Capitals @russianmachine @Pensburgh @Pensblog @NBCSCapitals Lol. I‚Äôve been to plenty of games, from season openers to the Stanley Cup Finals. Plenty on my couch, too. Surely you‚Äôll admit, then, that Crosby and Ovechkin would‚Äôve been on separate lines. Hence the team would‚Äôve been far less dangerous than with 2 dominant centers. * 2020-04-27T13:45:58+00:00
@brianski71 @CRamirezCalif @ovi8 @penguins @Capitals @russianmachine @Pensburgh @Pensblog @NBCSCapitals I had season tickets for a decade. Three Stanley cups. Does that equal five minutes? Where did you watch those games from your couch? * 2020-04-27T13:43:52+00:00

How many days a week did you practice hockey when you were my age?Who was your favourite coach as a kid?What did you learn from them?Keep up the great work.I really hope to see you win another Stanley Cup.I‚Äôll be cheering for you.Your biggest fan, Ben Z * 2020-04-18T13:55:22+00:00

Alex Ovechkin has lost out on 130 games due to lockouts/pandemics (doesn‚Äôt include injuries/rest). Using his career G/GP. He missed out on 80 goals. Putting him at 786 and 108 away from Gretzky. The fact that he can and likely will pass him still is INSANE @ovi8 @WayneGretzky * 2020-04-14T18:46:12+00:00
@Shane_Appelle03 @Sportsnet @NHL @Capitals @ovi8 @NHLFlames @MarkGio05 @PredsNHL @mnwild @rsuter20 con.... I got every age represented in the first 16 seasons (ages 18-33) except ages 29 &amp; 32.Also got Howe's age 40 season on the list. All other age seasons I had to look up and compare. Then I had to decide who I thought had the best from that age seasons. * 2020-04-13T17:05:19+00:00
@Shane_Appelle03 @Sportsnet @NHL @Capitals @ovi8 @NHLFlames @MarkGio05 @PredsNHL @mnwild @rsuter20 Haha, yeah unreal. I was gonna stop at age 40 because that wouldve been 23 seasons from from age 18. Most players dont play that long and if- dont  have a significant season like Howes. After doing some research I realized Bowers 41 year old season was significant so I added it. * 2020-04-13T16:54:50+00:00

My all time favorite quote from @ovi8 has gotta be ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not going to be suck.‚Äù That definitely describes the @Capitals 2017-2018 season. * 2020-04-13T01:26:22+00:00
@Sportsnet @NHL @Capitals @ovi8 @NHLFlames @MarkGio05 @PredsNHL @mnwild @rsuter20 BTW, his stats for a player's age during a particular seasons for assists are even more incredible. I believe he owns like 14 of the first 15 seasons from ages 18-32. Adam Oates might have a season in there up around age 30? Either way, his assists stats are even more stupendous. * 2020-04-12T21:49:07+00:00

@RobK_94 @JLoy76 @NHLonNBCSports @Capitals @ovi8 This. Look at highlight reels of goals from that era. Sooooo many would be saved with ease by today‚Äôs goalies. It was common to just wind up and take slappers on *rushes* back then lol and it would often work. Ovi would score 100+ yearly * 2020-04-01T19:07:25+00:00
@NHLonNBCSports @Capitals @ovi8 This is absolutely embarrassing coming from a so called "professional hockey network" 

There is a reason Gretzky has about 200 more goals and that's simply because he is the best of all time. Ovechkin is good too but no where close to Wayne. https://t.co/AzOHr0le4s * 2020-04-01T19:06:57+00:00

The craziest part of @ovi8 and his goal total is how much time has been taken from him. He lost a full season in 04-05, lost half a season in 12-13, and now might lose another quarter of a season this year. The first year alone is at least another 30-40 goals. * 2020-03-26T18:55:50+00:00

How about that Caps organization? Has anyone that is a STH received an email from the Caps since the NHL suspended the season?

The #COVID„Éº19 is a conspiracy from the Canadian government to slow @ovi8 down so he doesn't pass Gretzky's goal record before he retires. 

Prove me wrong. * 2020-03-15T18:29:22+00:00

@Sportsnet @WayneGretzky @GenePrincipe @ovi8 @NHL Great interview and always the gentleman Wayne Gretzky. I met his dad at a speaking he did and I understood where he Wayne gets his humble heart and roots from. Great man and memories * 2020-02-24T09:25:14+00:00
@Sportsnet @WayneGretzky @GenePrincipe @ovi8 @NHL I love our game, what great ambassadors. God bless Wayne, Walter, Gordie, and Ovi. Those players and programs from across the pond have improved the game and pushed @HockeyCanada and @usahockey to higher levels. * 2020-02-24T05:12:11+00:00
@WayneGretzky @ovi8 @NHL Thanks from Russia, Wayne. https://t.co/sYtdRQxJX6 * 2020-02-24T04:39:11+00:00
I hope this guy touches (or drinks from) the Stanley Cup this year, especially if Toronto wins it. Make it happen NHL!
@BizNasty2point0  @kbieksa3  @ovi8 @TheEllenShow 
You have the power! https://t.co/TMIC8DAxHO * 2020-02-24T03:39:45+00:00
@NHLGIFs @NHL @ovi8 This goal from 2015 was an absolute snipe https://t.co/vy3IlRsq4q * 2020-02-24T02:37:47+00:00
@Capitals @ovi8 As long as the Caps score seven goals/game from here on out, should be no problem! * 2020-02-24T02:15:55+00:00
After becoming 8th player in @NHL history to reach 700 goals plateau in his team's road loss last night to @NJDevils, @Capitals LW @ovi8 will greatly enjoy having presence of a scoring legend from Soviet Union like himself in #IlyaKovalchuk, who has 442 career @NHL goals. * 2020-02-24T01:59:29+00:00
@T__Easy @ovi8 Still a dirty hit from behind * 2020-02-24T01:46:10+00:00
In other news, @ovi8 continues to be a national treasure after 700 goals. I also forgot about the bald eagle @Capitals jerseys from ages ago. Time isn't real. * 2020-02-24T01:00:39+00:00
@NHLGIFs @ovi8 I like the one where he scored a one-timer PP goal from the circle. You know the one. * 2020-02-23T20:40:28+00:00

The irony of @ovi8 scoring number 700 on 2/22-the 40th Anniversary of the US winning gold at Lake Placid-I know we did not beat the USSR for the Gold that day, but at age 13 in 1980 there was no way you could imagine a player from Russia being an All-Time  @NHL great! #ALLCAPS https://t.co/4jmiQUzhng * 2020-02-23T20:00:48+00:00
@NHLGIFs @ovi8 Don't forget the one from his knees against NYR in the playoffs * 2020-02-23T20:00:01+00:00
you can see the exact mid-air moment Marcus Petterson's butthole clenches up to his throat from @ovi8's hit.

@Edzo16 says @ovi8 wouldn't have 700 goals in a prior era because current rules favor offense. That "analysis" neglects the fact that most players from prior eras, @Edzo16 included, wouldn't even make it in the AHL today. @ovi8 has played against exponentially better opponents. * 2020-02-23T18:54:56+00:00
This should be the biggest story from yesterday! Congratulations @ovi8 what an amazing feat! &amp; good luck reaching your next goal!!

@KurtLeavins ‚ÄòTwas implied since, as you put it, his accomplishment was the 2nd biggest @NHL news story of the night. Purely circumstantial as I added as his accomplishment is absolutely huge. I‚Äôm not trying to take away from @ovi8.

I suppose ‚Äúovershadowed‚Äù might be a better choice of words. * 2020-02-23T17:25:34+00:00

@AntGif @peterp0206 @Capitals @NHL @WayneGretzky @ovi8 all players on 700+ list are from previous eras. also check average season stats in Gretzky's one. Ovi clearly is the greatest goal scorer of all time even at this point. * 2020-02-23T15:27:29+00:00

What did @ovi8's 700th goal - and the ensuing celebration - look like from ice level? Wilson, Jensen, Kuznetsov, Reirden, Backstrom, Carlson, Kempny, Samsonov, Subban, Simmonds, Blackwood and, of course, Ovi, explain the moment | @Tarik_ElBashir

@richiepelletier @troll_six @NHL @ovi8 If I was to pick a player from that list to be on my team, I'd pick a healthy Mario Lemieux. He played on some pretty crap teams and got those goals on his own. Those other guys had pretty good supporting casts to help them. * 2020-02-23T06:52:41+00:00
Hey @ovi8 from one Russian to another, Congrats brother, you deserve it. Continue on being great!

I remember more than a decade ago we were writing about @Ovi8‚Äôs ability/marketability in @SportsPro. Privilege to be in the arena today to see his 700th career goal and a lovely standing ovation from @NJDevils fans (the fact they won 3-2 helped with that).

@PR_NHL @A_Kalnins @ovi8 @Capitals What‚Äôs interesting is that from 34 on, Gretzky went off a cliff. Ovi doesn‚Äôt seem to be slowing down at all. * 2020-02-23T01:11:53+00:00
Congrats to @ovi8 What an incredible accomplishment. But for anyone who forgets how great #waynegretzky  was he did it in 886 games; #Ovi700 did it in 1144. Yes different eras but no one from THAT era is in Wayne's area code so show some respect to the Great One too #nhl #Oilers https://t.co/d2Gze1aW3Q * 2020-02-23T01:08:50+00:00

With 700 goals, @ovi8 is 194 goals away from @WayneGretzky ‚Äòs record. Means he would have to score 40 goals per year for approximately 5 years. Can he do it? It‚Äôs one of those records I thought I would never see broken. #nhl @TonyMarinaro * 2020-02-23T00:38:55+00:00
Congrats @ovi8 on #700.  No one can take  that away from you. * 2020-02-23T00:20:58+00:00
@PR_NHL @ovi8 @Capitals He is 34 and if he averaged 30 goal seasons from here on it would take him  6.5 seasons to reach Gretzky. People bodies start to break down at the age he is at now. I don‚Äôt think he will reach Gretzky. * 2020-02-22T23:47:45+00:00

Moving away from the team negativity: @ovi8 is the Gr8est gift I‚Äôve ever had as a hockey player. As a young kid who loved Bondra, Gonchar and Kolzig, I just wanted a winner. We got one.

At ‚Äò06 NHL draft in Vancouver a VIP bus continually brought dignitaries to Rogers Arena. @Ovi8 emerged from the bus, made a beeline for @Hockeychick6890, signed a single autograph and was promptly escorted into the arena. Who died and made her Gary Bettman? #otherfansthinkingWTF * 2020-02-22T23:13:17+00:00
@DaAnsahonSports @WayneGretzky @ovi8 The big argument for most is goalies. Idk because I wasn‚Äôt alive but most people say the goaltending back then was atrocious compared to now. Now like I said idk if that‚Äôs true but that‚Äôs the biggest argument I‚Äôve heard. Not from Caps fans btw but hockey fans in general * 2020-02-22T23:02:20+00:00

@incarceratedbob @NHL @ovi8 Ok that‚Äôs what I assumed but thanks for clearing that up. Still not taking anything away from these guys, but if you can play 15-20 3 on 3 OTs a season def helps you get to those milestones a little quicker than Gretzky Bossy etc. not to mention taking away the red line * 2020-02-22T21:45:06+00:00
@Capitals fans the long wait to 700 is over for @ovi8 , but we lose to NJ 3-2. We also got 1 from @tom_wilso  &amp; overall samy looked great but we just couldn‚Äôt get the bounces. W/Pitt coming tomorrow hopefully we can regain sole possession of 1st in metro.

@Capitals fans, we got the point but lost in OT. It was a great game; @ovi8  now 699 and goals from @lellerofficial and @tom_wilso . It was dramatic as we get that last goal with @Holts170 out of net and 20 seconds left, but just lost it in OT. Next time!

@alextbegreat12 @NHL @ovi8 He scores from the same spot? He does score goals from "his office" but...  highly trained professional athletes and coaches KNOW he's going to be, and they still can't stop it.

@theoffwing @ovi8 @ArizonaCoyotes There is no shot. Believe me, i love Ovi and think he is unbelievable. BUT, the game he plays...which is physical and never shying from contact simple says his body breaks down way before he breaks Gretzky record. * 2020-02-03T00:16:04+00:00
@NHLonNBCSports @ovi8 @Capitals Why is Messier in a Rangers Jersey? A majority of his goals were scored as an Oiler. Oh, and he‚Äôs from Edmonton! * 2020-02-02T16:11:57+00:00
@Capitals @Nationals I wanna know who got the puck from goal #5 last night. Was it @JohnCarlson74 for becoming the all time assist leader for a @Capitals d-man or @ovi8 for moving into #8 on the all time goal scored list? * 2020-02-01T13:16:36+00:00
@TomGulittiNHL @Laughlin18 It took @ovi8 4 years &amp; 21 days to go from 500 to 700. I took him 690 days to go from 600 to 700. You really doubt the RMNB can score 194 more goals?? Make sure this guy is not invited to the party. * 2020-02-01T12:52:55+00:00

@NHL @ovi8 The mans can score from any position or body position on the ice. He will beat #99 * 2020-01-19T04:54:20+00:00
@ovi8 today scored back-to-back hat tricks for 3rd straight season. He now has 34 goals, now on pace for 56 goals. In 3 games, he's scored 8 goals &amp; jumped from 12th (684) to 9th (692) all-time. A 50-goal season would get 7th (708) all-time. Exciting times for @ovi8 &amp; @Capitals. * 2020-01-19T04:47:32+00:00
Take nothing away from @ovi8 ‚Äî most dangerous goal scorer of almost any generation. But @MarioLemieuxFdn scored 613 goals in 745 games BEFORE taking off 3 1/2 seasons and potting 35 in 43 games in 2000-01.

@NHL @ovi8 200 more games it took him, not taking anything away from what hes done. One of the best goal scorer ever. That's it, no way is he better than Crosby. He was finally able to pass him up in career points only because he has played 100+games more than him. * 2020-01-19T01:35:27+00:00

@HyruleNights @NHL @ovi8 Go look at the Penguins' players from 1984-1990 too. He played with pure garbage players. He played with a bad back. Also, look at goals per game in recent years. Scoring is up. Plus your argument is better vs. 99. Not so much w/ 66 who played in the 90's/00's. * 2020-01-18T23:26:51+00:00

There is no one even close to him from active players * 2020-01-18T22:30:44+00:00
I have gained a lot of respect for Ovechkin the past few years. I truly hope he beats Gretzky‚Äôs record of 894 goals. He will pass 700 this season without a doubt, and from there on he will need almost 200 goals before he hangs the gloves. Definitely possible. @ovi8 #AllCaps * 2020-01-18T22:06:38+00:00

He legitimately could have broken Gretzky's record and it would have gone down to him or Ovie for 1st &amp; 2nd. As far as Ovie breaking the record, at 894, he'll be 6 away from 900. Why not eclipse 900 before retiring? * 2020-01-18T21:07:41+00:00

@CDPGH @TKHL14 @UMmmmDC @j_hoffman3 @NHLonNBCSports @Capitals @ovi8 22% of his goals came in a single fucking season. He played in an era where he was able to put up 199 points. From 90-97 when he played there were 49 100 point scores in the top 10 scoring. Including a year where all 10 had more than 120 points. * 2020-01-18T19:46:09+00:00
@236FM @TheFarquaad @jmacyourlife @NHL @ovi8 Yep, Mario did it in less games but in a higher scoring era. This era will likely never see an 80 goal season from a player.  But regardless why not appreciate the greatness of both players? * 2020-01-18T19:38:51+00:00
@Jaromir_Jagr @OCDDAD @236FM @jmacyourlife @NHL @ovi8 Yeah but goalies didn't know the butterfly, smaller pads, no neutral zone trap existed. There is a reason the 80s are so high scoring. Ovi has only scored 20+ overtime goals total, including playoff goals. His speed/shot power/accuracy would have destroyed goalies from back then. * 2020-01-18T19:21:51+00:00
#ALLCAPS The Great 8 makes passing another historic milestone look easy.  A living legend from the corner office, @ovi8 passes Mario Lemieux in career goals tonight.

@jmacyourlife @PlyrMava @NHL @ovi8 Obstruction and hooking don't matter when you can rip a wrister from the point and it goes in half the time. * 2020-01-18T19:07:33+00:00
@236FM @jmacyourlife @NHL @ovi8 Is that why only a handful of people from that era were anywhere close to Lemieuxs #‚Äôs? * 2020-01-18T19:03:52+00:00
@Jaromir_Jagr @jmacyourlife @NHL @ovi8 Gretzky, Lemieux, Jagr etc. are all still GOATs. My point was that comparing 2 legends from 2 different eras simply by saying one scored their goals faster is completely meaningless and doesn't accurately compare the two. * 2020-01-18T19:03:01+00:00
@DrewSan91029374 @NHLonNBCSports @Capitals @ovi8 I don‚Äôt want to take anything away from either player, but it was obviously way easier to score in Lemieux era. But I do think he was also better * 2020-01-18T19:00:06+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 Great pass from Backstrom * 2020-01-18T18:50:34+00:00

@dliebs45 @TeemuSel8nne @ovi8 For sure.  Ovi without a doubt has been the beneficiary of a lot of equipment advances.  And rule changes. But goalies back in the '80's were a much different athlete.  Defensemen the same.  From just a pure "goal-scoring ability" standpoint, I think he is probably the greatest. * 2020-01-14T04:10:25+00:00

@napier720 @NHLonNBCSports @Capitals @ovi8 9 Rocket Richard scoring titles....

4 seasons till he breaks the all time scoring record....

Stanley Cup Champ....

Caps have more wins than all 30 other NHL teams the past 10 years.....

Ovi will likely be the greatest scorer of all time.....

Easy to judge from the stands.... * 2020-01-09T02:17:20+00:00
With a goal tonight, @ovi8 would not only pass Teemu Selanne for 11th all time, he'd be five away from 690 and tying Mario Lemieux and would also be 210 goals for passing Wayne Gretzky for the No.1 leading goal scorer in @NHL history. #ALLCAPS * 2020-01-09T01:06:40+00:00
History Watch - Alex Ovechkin @ovi8 is now 16 Goals away from 700!!!! And 83 from Jagr and moving into 3rd place All Time. * 2020-01-08T22:46:39+00:00
We are on a roll @Capitals fans with a 6-1 win over the Sens. Choppy at first but the boys in red came through!  Scoring was abundant wirh a pair from both @ovi8 and @TJOshie77 , and one from @lellerofficial and @radkogudas . Sammy looking strong in net.

@penguins @Letang_58 Nah let's swing it the other way. Don't vote him in. Give him the rest. Everyone should learn from @ovi8 * 2019-12-30T21:18:43+00:00
Early career ovi was so crazy. To think in 07-08 (I know that wasn‚Äôt this decade) season he netted 65 goals. Still the best season I‚Äôve seen in my lifetime from an individual player. Was dominant in every aspect of the game. We‚Äôve been lucky to watch this guy. @ovi8 https://t.co/VzkkiPXqI4 * 2019-12-30T15:58:32+00:00
@NHLonNBCSports @ovi8 @Capitals As a fan of a division rival, much respect for him from me. His legacy is certainly not one to be underestimated. * 2019-12-30T14:28:58+00:00
@GAT0Raids @ovi8 I get it from a business stand point but it‚Äôs such a bad look. IMO * 2019-12-30T02:41:21+00:00
Well we got more goals tonight @Capitals fans but we lost to the Canes 6-4. We got goals from @JimmyDowder26 , @ovi8 , @Kuzya92 and @radkogudas . We just have to gear up and finish 2019 strong. 

27-8-5; 59 points; 1st in Metro, conference and league 

https://t.co/GLu8VdNbpD * 2019-12-29T05:42:03+00:00
@KellyMayBishop @ovi8 Yeah the context of his goals is different from Howe and Gretzky. Goalie equipment is much bigger and goalie philosophy is much more advanced now. So many rules and team defensive sets to prevent scoring that didn‚Äôt exist 20-30 years ago. I‚Äôm a big Gretzky guy but Ovi is my fave. * 2019-12-29T03:41:41+00:00
@PR_NHL @NHL @Capitals @ovi8 Has he ever scored from that spot before? * 2019-12-29T02:54:11+00:00
Take that @ovi8 from @ASvechnikov_37 * 2019-12-29T02:32:43+00:00
Now I'm biased (emphatically), but I contend @ovi8 is already the greatest. I mean, SO many of my favorite goals have come from the corner officeüòâ

With # 256 tonight, @ovi8 continues pursuit to be most prolific in this particular category. Just sayin' #ALLCAPS https://t.co/An35FcIqlf * 2019-12-29T02:30:21+00:00

I‚Äôm laughing so hard at some people getting mad at Ovechkin for skipping the All Star game. Which has become a degraded joke and a far cry from the best of the West versus the East. Rest up @ovi8 - best player in the game. * 2019-12-28T20:54:02+00:00

I got such great mail today from @PapaJohns and it made me so happy. They sent me a tee I'd seen the @capitals @ovi8 wearing while delivering pizzas a few weeks ago. It came in a pizza box!

@Z_Pawelkiewicz @NHL @AM34 @ovi8 I did. Just thought I would reinforce it by pointing out that he dishes A LOT of hits EVERY year. That takes dedication , strength, grit &amp; is far from being easy to do. Ovi is many things but Lazy isn't one of them. * 2019-11-02T01:01:10+00:00
@Presidan @NHL @AM34 @ovi8 Umm, doesn't Ovi have like 40 goals total from different spots of the Ice? The rest are from the small brain PP spot, excuse me Powerplay Spot.
When was his last flip flop highlight goal? 2014? Or longer? I legit don't remember his last highlight goal that wasn't on the small PP. * 2019-11-01T20:55:41+00:00

@Capitals @ovi8 @NHL Very classy move by Lucky Luc! Ovi now has the most goals of any LW in NHL history (the remaining 11 above him are all either C or RW).

He'll need 133 more to pass Gordie Howe if he wants the all-time goal mark for wingers, and 226 more to take first overall from Wayne Gretzky. * 2019-10-31T15:01:32+00:00

@SJSharkz19 @PR_NHL @ovi8 Ya the thing is he can score those PP goals forever as long as the shot stays lol he literally doesnt need to move.. he could score from there on a Walker probably lol * 2019-10-30T19:41:00+00:00

@BarDown @ovi8 @Capitals @NHL But the point is...they broke through. That's some great wisdom coming from a player who's been there, done that, changed his game and won the cup. * 2019-10-30T14:11:15+00:00
@mattRDcampbell @BarDown @TSN_Sports @ovi8 @Capitals @NHL Exactly lol. Seeing some immaturity in that response rather than yeah, we have to learn from that. * 2019-10-30T13:30:25+00:00
@BarDown @ovi8 @Capitals @NHL Exactly @AM34 ....how many times. 
Use it as a learning experience and not a shot. You‚Äôve lost now twice to Boston. You want to do it again? Is what ovie is saying...until you learn to play for your team on the ice you won‚Äôt win. Ovie is right. LEARN FROM IT! Don‚Äôt be defensive * 2019-10-30T13:29:48+00:00
@MayHockeyNBCS @ovi8 It's been a gift to be able to watch him from the time he entered the league. Kid, adult, captain, husband, father and true leader. @ovi8 gets it! * 2019-10-30T13:21:10+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 Does he score goals from any other fucking spot on the ice? * 2019-10-30T12:57:07+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 Always from the office.  Nobody gets it! * 2019-10-30T12:33:08+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 Everyone knows that's where he's shooting from. Just amazing. * 2019-10-30T10:10:30+00:00

@VGK207 @PR_NHL @ovi8 That's exactly why he's the best. The goalie knows where the shot is coming from and he STILL makes it. Also stop sleeping on his puck handling skills * 2019-10-27T01:44:47+00:00
@VGK207 @PR_NHL @ovi8 Bruh, one-t's from the half wall are only like 30% of his game, just spend a little time watching him play on and off the puck * 2019-10-26T23:08:21+00:00
@VGK207 @PR_NHL @ovi8 Apparently you haven‚Äôt watched him play very long. He scores from more than that spot alone.  Really why should he stop. You all couldn‚Äôt stop it in the 2018 Final * 2019-10-26T18:07:55+00:00

@VGK207 @PR_NHL @ovi8 You're wrong, but even if you were right...so what? The point is to score more goals, not to score prettier goals or score a wider variety of goals. You don't get a gold star every time you score from a different place. * 2019-10-25T23:24:19+00:00
@VGK207 @PR_NHL @ovi8 And yet, he still scores, mmm? You need a chart to show you what he does or call up that guy from @Canes who still hear footsteps * 2019-10-25T23:13:23+00:00
#Oilers 4, #Caps 3 (OT): Draisaitl won it 1:18 into OT on his second goal of the night. His first started a comeback from 3-1 down in the third and @cmcdavid97 finished with his equalizer with 1:38 to play. @ovi8 scored twice for WAS. * 2019-10-25T16:49:13+00:00
@z_white_13 @ackerjg @SWGSD1979 @NHL @ovi8 The guy can dangle someone into submission, wreck someone with a hit, be a big body force in front of the net, he can bomb shots from far out with no screen and score * 2019-10-25T16:40:07+00:00

@NHL @ovi8 @rogbennett @MenInBlazers @Capitals Hilarious, a sports team made up of 99% white males takes down a statue of dead performer.  Are you going to ban ALL rap singers from your audience the few that attend.Their shit is racist, violent, especially toward women.  So pathetic to be sheep.

Specifically about that shot. * 2019-04-20T18:11:28+00:00
@CPTAlaska @ovi8 @Capitals That's right! Trying to be in the "eye of the storm" by puck drop.

@mandrewood Breaking his collarbone was unintentional. The crosscheck from behind was intentional.  Really, dirty plays from @TJOshie77 @ovi8  and @tom_wilso every game?

Couple takeaways from the Canes playoff game last night:

1. The Champions Club Level seating is top notch. 

2. The atmosphere last night was probably the best I‚Äôve witnessed in person.

3. The @NHLCanes feed off the crowd and it shows.

4. @ovi8 is good, but a huge prick! * 2019-04-19T12:04:14+00:00
@ovi8 You have a child of your own and are our Captain, so I wanted to send this from last April before the first Cup...we still believe in #BACKTOBACK and know adversity makes one stronger.

@suldog19 @Prospects_Watch Since you were not at the game, I was @Martyman17  had to be restrained from going after @ovi8  when he came out after serving his penalty by Game Officials and later on Dougie Hamilton was saying something into his ear as he skated away * 2019-04-18T16:53:49+00:00
I like this @ovi8. He may not fight much, but when he does, he wins.

Perfect start to the #stanleycup playoffs for @Capitals: Two goals from Nicklas Backstrom (@backstrom19), one goal from Alexander Ovechkin (@ovi8) and three assists from @JohnCarlson74 have the defending champs up 3-0 over @NHLCanes after one period. @8NEWS * 2019-04-12T00:28:19+00:00
@ovi8 just bulls thru his own man @tom_wilso to get the goal and put @Capitals up 3-0! What a first period from the defending #StanleyCupChamps #ALLCAPS * 2019-04-12T00:20:42+00:00
Let‚Äôs go @Capitals . Time to beat da @NHLCanes . I may live in Raleigh, but don‚Äôt get it twisted. I‚Äôm from Washington D.C. and hoping for a repeat. One cup is cool, but two is even better.

@ChrisSilveyMLB @JoeDanger2728 @NHL @86Kucherov @ovi8 Oh absolutely, I think his numbers became insane with what was it, 3 straight shutouts? Same with Bob from CBJ. I think Bishop was super underrated this year, and I think part of that has to do with injuries, and another part was the Stars record too. I loved him in TBL * 2019-04-09T00:08:04+00:00

Loving this Caps-Pens game.  What a milestone night.  1,200 points for @ovi8 and 1,000 for Malkin.  Unreal.   4-3.  Here.  We.....go.  Sabres looked good tonight too from what Twitter said.  What a joke.  Skinner.  You know what to do.  Shit show. * 2019-03-13T01:32:40+00:00

@OldHockeyDude @NHLonNBCSports @ovi8 He was the best pure goal scorer I've ever seen, he could score from anywhere. I think ovie is great but Bossy was the best. 
I watched a Gretzky interview once and he said Bossy was the best pure sniper. * 2019-03-09T04:07:03+00:00
@HockeyAnalyst25 @cashisking011 @_burnstuff @NHLonNBCSports @ovi8 Ovie, is one of the best. Not taking a thing away from his ability. The whole league has respect for his scoring abilities. I got to see Bossy play. He didn‚Äôt have the slapper that Ovie has, but he could hit any part of the net while in stride, with such an accuracy. * 2019-03-09T03:00:01+00:00

Hey @Capitals! My birthday is next Tuesday and I know the team is up in Pittsburgh. I was wondering if I could get a birthday shout out video from @Kuzya92, @ovi8, @tom_wilso, @backstrom19, @TJOshie77, @JVranaa, @JohnCarlson74, and @Holts170. * 2019-03-08T02:11:22+00:00
@dolphinsgm2019 @rickinabox1 @nikitaov2221 @NHLonNBCSports @SonsOfHockey @ovi8 Except that you could dump it in from center and score when Gretzky player and you have to thread it over a goalies shoulder in a 3 inch gap now. It isn‚Äôt even comparable how much easier it was to rack up goals. Goalies often just kicked a single leg out.. * 2019-03-07T20:30:22+00:00
@dolphinsgm2019 @_ianmatheson @nikitaov2221 @NHLonNBCSports @SonsOfHockey @ovi8 If you look at the normal non-flashy goals from those era, the vast majority would be easily saved by modern day goalies. I wasn‚Äôt kidding when I said guys would score on slappers from the blue line on rushes, bc goalies were just so easy to beat * 2019-03-07T18:42:19+00:00
@dolphinsgm2019 @_ianmatheson @nikitaov2221 @NHLonNBCSports @SonsOfHockey @ovi8 It objectively is much harder to score nowadays even when considering the better sticks. I mean goalies used to play 10ft out of the net and defenses were much less refined than today. Ovi would put up like 90 each year from his powerplay spot alone bc nets would be wide open * 2019-03-07T18:40:51+00:00
#Caps 5, #Flyers 3: Caps score the first five, win their fifth straight , getting a goal and assist from @ovi8 and going two points up in the Metro. * 2019-03-07T18:15:08+00:00
@NHLonNBCSports @ovi8 1.) Goalies are better now
2.) Goalie equipment is bigger now
3.) Defenses are better now
4.) Teams have depth now
5.) His shot is so good he can take it from the same spot ice every time and nobody stops it

Ovi is the greatest scorer ever. Stop trying to fight it. Accept it. * 2019-03-07T17:13:07+00:00

@NHL @ovi8 The funny part is Ovi is under 100 assists away from matching his goal total. Crosby is 300 away from matching * 2019-03-07T10:03:40+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 how many of those points were scored from the left circle? over 50%? 60%? * 2019-03-07T09:10:40+00:00
@the_dzarina @mattybalonso @j_ferrelli @NHLonNBCSports @ovi8 Very true, I think he could handle a wooden stick and he‚Äôs not really a fancy puck handler so the stick handling probably wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue and he‚Äôs as strong as a lot of the guys from back then and could probably laser the puck still and scare the shit out of goalies * 2019-03-07T03:47:29+00:00
@dtrain_1975 @Seaabastian @BootsMcGavin @NHLonNBCSports @ovi8 Omg if you think it‚Äôs easier to score in today‚Äôs game than in 99‚Äôs era! Have you seen how bad the goaltending was back than? No butterfly, pads smaller than what D-men where now.... not taking anything away from Gretz, but the goalies sucked ass * 2019-03-07T03:08:06+00:00
@NHLonNBCSports @ovi8 No chance the goalies from Gretzky‚Äôs era block Ovi‚Äôs shots with the small amount of protection they had.   Some of his shots could‚Äôve probably maimed them.  Plus, Ovi would be hitting people like Scott Stevens if he played during that era. * 2019-03-07T02:55:42+00:00
@nikitaov2221 @dolphinsgm2019 @NHLonNBCSports @SonsOfHockey @ovi8 Some people idiotically think the greatest goal scorer is as simple as whoever has the most total...if Ovi played in Gretzky‚Äôs era he‚Äôd break 100 goals yearly. Back then you‚Äôd see players score by taking slap shots from the blue line on rushes because goalies were so bad * 2019-03-07T02:18:00+00:00
Damn what‚Äôs Alex Ovechkin favourite thing to do other then Carry around the Stanley cup everywhere he goes and get hammered from drinking out of it is leading the nhl in goals. The guy is a goalies nightmare!! @ovi8 * 2019-03-07T02:11:02+00:00

@kwuser21 @Pittsburghfan97 @jtnssava @npaxton1234 @Caps412 @Philippe_Tweets @NHL @ovi8 Ovi was older but going from KHL to NHL hard to adjust from considering the size of the rink and the type of hockey is completely different than the NHL. Plus they don't factor in age for the Calder, just production and Ovi was exciting and amazing that year. * 2019-03-04T17:29:51+00:00
@kwuser21 @KingS37660272 @jtnssava @npaxton1234 @Caps412 @Philippe_Tweets @NHL @ovi8 No matter what crosby is still the better overall player. Not a debate. He‚Äôs always been for the team and his assists show for it, but when he scores goals he scores a new way all the time and from almost anywhere on the ice. The only stat he doesn‚Äôt have over ovi is total goals. * 2019-03-04T17:10:27+00:00
Embarrassing refereeing again by the @NHL referees. @NYRangers goalie Gerorgiev throws his stick at @ovi8 during a shootout. Refs get together, agree on a decision, call no goal. Refs get a call (likely from Toronto or anyone with a brain) and they reverse the call. Disgusting. * 2019-03-03T20:47:14+00:00

@Pittsburghfan97 @Philippe_Tweets @Wilkyway12345 @bowlingbraviary @NHL @ovi8 Yup, pity he didn't have another HOF on his team like Crosby does . Oh and there's a grand total of .170 difference in Crosby and Ovi's career PPG in the playoffs despite the fact that Ovi is a winger. But hey, dont let things like fact stop u from being a terrible yinzer cliche. * 2019-03-02T15:35:26+00:00

@Philippe_Tweets @bowlingbraviary @Wilkyway12345 @NHL @ovi8 Don‚Äôt need to play to know that ovechkin is a choker and that crosby not only scores goals but consistently sets up his teammates for goal scoring chances oh and he does it from more than one spot on the ice unlike Mr. top of the circle. * 2019-03-02T14:53:40+00:00
@ovi8 deserves the Heart this year. Take Kucherov away from Tampa they still are a top 5-10 team. CM97 and PK88 teams aren‚Äôt in the playoffs.

@TylerDowd18 @LetsGoFlyera @NHL @ovi8 Or Oshie. Or hell Carlson has a blast from the point also. OP powerpoint. * 2019-02-19T05:11:46+00:00

@NoVa_Caps It just sucks that someone like Harper is going to make so much money but hasn‚Äôt had the same affect on his sport whereas @ovi8 has helped pave the way for so many hockey players from all around the globe.

@JasonRoseEh @NHL @ovi8 Lol ok buddy even if 29% of his goals are from the circle he still isn‚Äôt that great to watch. Plus if he was so good what‚Äôs with only winning 1 cup in 11 years?? Oh wait hockey‚Äôs a team game not a one man slap shot show. Silly caps fans don‚Äôt understand that sids a team guy+wins. * 2019-02-12T17:32:31+00:00
@JasonRoseEh @NHL @ovi8 The fact that you know that stat just goes to show how much you have to defend him from the statement. Also I do watch hockey and a real team at that, they‚Äôre called the Pittsburgh Penguins! You might have heard of them since they‚Äôre the caps daddy. https://t.co/2MxjAJcpX4 * 2019-02-12T17:25:25+00:00
@VictorReSean @mwelchanshfa @BMXStr8nger @NHL @ovi8 I mean he only scores from the same spot every time so I don‚Äôt know how great he is but if you look at oh I don‚Äôt know anyone other teams lead goal scorer im sure they do it a different way each time and it looks better because it doesn‚Äôt look like a replay of the same goal. * 2019-02-12T17:22:16+00:00

@Capitals @ovi8 Truly a beautiful letter.

I have two small qualms:

1. Hockey cards from the 90‚Äôs aren‚Äôt priceless. They are typically worthless.

2. Russian hockey is the best in the world? Not a chance üá®üá¶üòâ.

A PP goal from @ovi8 from his office puts the Caps up 1-0. Ovi moves past Shanahan for 6th place all time in PP goals and he ties Andreychuck for 14th all time in goals!! #ALLCAPS @WesJohnsonVoice https://t.co/C724TRp9Iu * 2019-01-15T00:37:39+00:00

Who should be my next @Capitals jersey? * 2019-01-11T19:21:43+00:00
@GoldAsIce @ovi8 @Capitals @NHL That works on a seasonal basis, but on a career basis? Player A will (in all likelihood) play a different # games from Player B, who will, in turn, play a diff # of games from Player C, etc.

If it's a matter of uniformity, over the course of careers that's not gonna hold up. * 2019-01-11T17:55:51+00:00
Only @ovi8 could score twice, knock Chara into the bench, make two kids' nights, fly back from Boston, and end the night partying in Clarendon.

Milestone Update:

@ovi8 is 2 goals away from passing Dave Andreychuk for 14th on the all time goals scoring list. 
@ovi8 is also only 9 points away from passing Sergei Fedorov for most points all-time by a Russian.

He is only 33 years old. Appreciate greatness, people. * 2019-01-11T15:26:29+00:00

And that'll do it, @ovi8 with an empty-netter from deep in his own end. 4-2 Caps, B's might never beat Washington again #NHLBruins #Capitals #MetroBoston * 2019-01-11T02:40:30+00:00

@JasonRoseEh @BIueWaveDem @NHL @ovi8 I do, whole heartedly. There are far more valuable players than him in the league. And he benefits from Washington giving him the most shots in the league. If you can‚Äôt understand that then you don‚Äôt understand hockey. Goals are hardly everything. * 2019-01-04T02:42:09+00:00
@JasonRoseEh @BIueWaveDem @NHL @ovi8 Tbf a good chunk of his goal do come off the power play however a majority come from even strength. He is a specialist in the sense that he‚Äôs literally the best power play goal scorer in the league. Has led in many seasons. * 2019-01-04T01:55:33+00:00
For the All-Star game, why doesn‚Äôt the @NHL adopt a policy where after like 1000 games of service a player can be exempt from playing in it, or after going like 5X a player can opt out. I don‚Äôt like players not attending like @ovi8, but also appreciate they want a break ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è * 2019-01-03T03:23:34+00:00

@NHL @ovi8 maybe giving Ovechkin an uncontested slap shot from the top of the circle is a bad idea, just putting that out there * 2018-12-16T01:49:50+00:00

@NBrown4325 @FilmstudyRavens @NHL @ovi8 @Capitals Gretzky greatest of all time don't see anyone coming close to player he was, he changed NHL it's rare for player to do what he did. I'm not taking away from what Ovie done and dont see him slowing down anytime soon, but you know why goaltending better today? Because Gretzky... * 2018-12-15T15:15:55+00:00

An amazing hockey night for the @Capitals and @ovi8. Why no recognition from @espn or @SportsCenter? * 2018-12-15T07:32:26+00:00
The great @ovi8 is now 429 games away from breaking #gretzky894 record, assuming his career scoring pace is maintained. He would be age 39.

I don‚Äôt think he will retire without that ‚Äòunbreakable‚Äô record. * 2018-12-15T04:58:38+00:00
@ianoland @russianmachine @ovi8 But he scored from the same spot as usual ;-) * 2018-12-15T04:53:34+00:00
@LizardKush @NHL @Enterprise @ovi8 Sounds like a typical post from either a Toronto Calgary or Detroit fan * 2018-12-15T04:37:59+00:00

Tonight's #CapsCanes game was wild. Some brutal play on both sides but highly entertaining from a fan's standpoint. Loved seeing @ovi8 record a hat trick in back-to-back games and I enjoyed the shootout victory for The District. #ALLCAPS * 2018-12-15T03:31:14+00:00
Awesome game from the @Capitals. @ovi8 putting up his second hat trick in a row and moving up to 6th in NHL history for most power play goals. Great game coming from both @NHL  teams. Beautiful game winner from @JVranaa.

@Jared_Shafit @PR_NHL @ovi8 @Capitals get it right, the missed call was on the 2nd goal which was after a weak ‚Äúholding‚Äù call on him which lead to a Canes 2nd goal so i‚Äôd say fair is fair üòè. this tweet is from the 1st goal gg lol * 2018-12-15T02:41:39+00:00

@FlyersFanFLA @NHL @ovi8 @adidashockey Let's just pretend you're right and Ovi only scores from the same spot (no he doesn't) why does that matter? Goals are goals. They don't ask how pretty, just how many and Ovi's got a lot. * 2018-12-15T02:34:49+00:00
@troychewning @NHL @ovi8 You clearly didn‚Äôt watch the video and how the caps player stares at him the whole time, hits him, a hit away from the play, which is literally interference. * 2018-12-15T02:27:15+00:00
I am wearing a hat tonight and @ovi8 has a chance in this third to get it. I am  7 rows from the ice. My fear is if he gets it I‚Äôll throw my hat into the net #allcaps @Capitals * 2018-12-15T02:20:44+00:00

@Bharper3407 @ovi8 From the outside looking in...

Being in the same city as #KB, but on opposite teams, seems to make u &amp; him better. #KB winning a title on the #Northside could drive u to win a title on the #Southside. Putting in 10+ yrs w/ CWS, like #Konerko, could be worthwhile.

#CapsKnights All game Ryan Reaves was a thug looking to get in @Capitals grills and provoke them from @ovi8 to @tom_wilso to #Orlov, etc.  he wasn't there to play the game - he was there to pick fights and target people.  That had to be with the encouragement of his coach. #Goon * 2018-12-05T08:58:57+00:00
I just saw @ovi8 score a goal in person.  Nothing new there.

The facts that it wasn't on a power play, from the top of the circle, against the #Isles?  That's new. * 2018-12-05T04:36:49+00:00

@09071979 @NHL @ovi8 Lmaoo he scored 2 goals that game and one from the place he plays 97 % of the time. Don‚Äôt think anybody is gonna figure it out. It‚Äôs HIS office for a reason. #thegr8 #wishfulthinking * 2018-11-21T15:18:58+00:00

5 years ago I would have said there isn‚Äôt anything @ovi8 could do that would make me like him...since then the guy continues to prove me wrong.

@russianmachine @Capitals this is my friend‚Äôs little brother Ryan and all he wanted was to see @ovi8 and as you see, he was trying to give him a puck but these grown men kept taking them. It would mean the world to him if he could get a puck from his idol Ovi! https://t.co/Nt5vGWviTx * 2018-11-20T23:37:02+00:00

@WaltonCaps Price deserved the congratulatory clap from @ovi8. It was purely amazing. I can‚Äôt believe the defense let him get open in his office for that one, but Price makes the save and earned the point for his team. * 2018-11-20T06:26:26+00:00

@NHL @ovi8 Absolute crap call by the refs on malkin tonight. Oshie created the contact, malkin nudged him off and TJ Oshie did his best Neymar impression. Guess who wasn't out long that came back into the game to score the gwg? Oshie. All out fail from some very questionable officiating * 2018-11-08T05:45:39+00:00

#Caps 4, #NYR 3 (OT): Niskanen scores in OT on rebound. That's a bit unusual, but @ovi8 scoring twice from the left circle on the PP is not. * 2018-10-18T20:01:06+00:00

@NHL @ovi8 Wow, Ovi scoring from the off circle. On a one timer. On the PP. Never seen that before. * 2018-10-18T14:19:39+00:00

@irishTPO311 @c_ell71 @NHLonNBCSports @ovi8 I gave this guy the goodnight treatment. I don‚Äôt think he is a usual Penguins fan troller, but his argument is still wrong.

A 2nd PP goal from @ovi8 ties him with Dino Ciccarrelli for 9th most PP goals in @NHL history.  As heard by @WesJohnsonVoice #ALLCAPS https://t.co/3H8v3ZkLtv * 2018-10-18T00:46:23+00:00
@ovi8 has made himself a superstar by mastering one shot from one location.  Imagine an NBA star who could only score from corner 3. * 2018-10-18T00:44:50+00:00
Why does any team leave @ovi8 open at the top of the R circle? He scores 80% of his goals from there. That PP was a prime example. One-timer goal easy * 2018-10-18T00:43:36+00:00

This is an incredible example of a natural goal scorer finding his "soft spot" to shoot from in the offensive zone, arriving there with perfect timing instead of going 100mph the whole shift. Great feed to him as well. #great8 @ovi8 https://t.co/QfeGF3T5zb * 2018-10-11T03:03:16+00:00

Offense Away from Puck - On the 1-3-1 PP, the player who plays in the "bumper" spot needs to understand that sometimes he is the "decoy" on the play so that the outside flank opens up. @Capitals #77 @TJOshie77 draws the defender which opens up #8 @ovi8. #PHTOTD https://t.co/jyClMys2zP * 2018-10-04T14:19:00+00:00

@TommiSeppala @ovi8 The NHL should tear Tom Wilson a 41-game cake like Torres. At the same time, I am still of the opinion that this problem should be tackled with great brutality also from the inside. Ovetshkin, Reirden, MacLella and even Leonsis.

Mike Gartner and @68Jagr both posted 15 consecutive 30-goal seasons, the longest such runs in League history. 

@ovi8 eyes his 14th straight 30-goal campaign in 2018-19.

@djbellefy Try the @ovi8, you can shoot it over the net from 4 inches outside the goal line and catching backhand passes is harder than balancing an egg on a sharpened pencil.  The #‚Äôs he puts up are insane but doing it with that bend is ridiculous. * 2018-08-10T13:23:23+00:00

Everybody's been obsessed with this stupid 10 sec. vid showing @ovi8 gaming, playing what seems to be #Fornite. All I've been obsessed with is how insanely hot his wife is. I mean, even my eyes get a boner from looking at her.. Hey Ovi, keep gaming while I take care of her, okay? https://t.co/5P1UlybygW * 2018-07-31T22:18:29+00:00

Review of #caps Stanley Cup DVD: Good insights from @Laughlin18 &amp; @JoeBpXp set the stage. A real focus on games themselves, capturing ups &amp; downs along the way. Bonus material is too short, and they cut out @ovi8's line about not being suck, which sucks. #ALLCAPS * 2018-07-30T19:40:29+00:00
@danyel19 @NHL @ovi8 @ESPYS Things seem to be looking up though üòÇ. I used to live about 5 mins away from Selhurst Park so every other Saturday was a swave of blue and red in the streets üòÇ * 2018-07-29T17:43:38+00:00
@OasisLGNGFan @NHL @ovi8 @ESPYS Yeah, North London not too far from Finsbury Park. I can walk to the Arsenal stadium from my house which is why i support them. Dunno if i should actually be happy about that though considering how awful we've been üòÇ * 2018-07-29T17:42:00+00:00
@danyel19 @NHL @ovi8 @ESPYS I've kinda lost track a bit but I support the Streatham Redhawks (I still think of them as the Redskins though üòÇ). They were my local team before I moved from London, used to love going to matches * 2018-07-29T17:22:55+00:00
@OasisLGNGFan @NHL @ovi8 @ESPYS Same, thought he was running out of time but he stuck with The Capitals and i honestly couldn't be more happy. I've watched all the documentaries and stuff that shows all the hard work and where he's come from. So for him to actually win is a dream come true * 2018-07-29T17:03:19+00:00

@Taterman3 @kulta64 @3erlei @Toyboy48 Last season 2017-2018 was called OVI8 season and  2018-2019 has already been named for Pulju season. So everything will be ok from possession, defensive and  offensive  perspective. So Do not worry, I know. * 2018-07-23T15:39:22+00:00

So I was watching some of @BizNasty2point0 old fights from his day as a NHL player. The announcer in one of the video goes ‚Äúand Paul is 2nd in the league in twitter followers only behind @ovi8 ‚Äú ...they wouldn‚Äôt even give a Hockey stat for this legend. * 2018-07-22T19:53:49+00:00
@sagitbob3 @keeperofthecup @Capitals @ovi8 @NHL @HockeyHallFame I understand your point but it was the first time in his entire career he was a team player.  There are at least 3 others that I would have liked to have seen get it, but hey I‚Äôm not even a caps fan.  I‚Äôm from Pittsburgh.  Lol no one here likes ovi.  We have our own fav Russian ! * 2018-07-22T00:43:53+00:00
@keeperofthecup @Capitals @ovi8 @NHL @HockeyHallFame As a Pens fan, I may be biased, but I feel like OV getting the Conn Smythe is because he's treated like he's the only member of the Capitals.    I never get "team spirit" vibe from him.  Unlike Crosby who player after player comment that he makes them play better. * 2018-07-21T14:31:39+00:00
@JStanley81 @SNFaizalKhamisa @DeMar_DeRozan @Raptors @ovi8 @Capitals Ok, get what you mean that the Caps never gave up @ovi8 but he signed a 13 yr contract w/the caps &amp; statistically made himself a superstar on a team that wasn't winning the cup &amp; chose to stay w/the Caps since they knew they had to build around him.  A bit different from DeMar. * 2018-07-21T13:09:11+00:00

@_tdome @RobOstrom @Capitals @ovi8 @NHL @ESPYS @espn So here it is for you bro. Career wise and regular season ovi has been better. Yeah, he‚Äôs failed in the playoffs so his numbers will be a little worse. But he‚Äôs overall better then Crosby. Sorry. This is from https://t.co/aqV4oKplve * 2018-07-20T22:56:13+00:00
@_tdome @RobOstrom @Capitals @ovi8 @NHL @ESPYS @espn Crosby had a supporting cast around him. Ovi got the job done with the same team that got knocked out several times by the penguins. So, since there‚Äôs people out there saying ovi sucks and it‚Äôs coming from penguin fans that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm bashing those fans. It‚Äôs just for fun! * 2018-07-20T22:24:24+00:00
@JV_PITT @HunterTerry_LV @PhilForPrez @Capitals @ovi8 @NHL @ESPYS @espn It‚Äôs funny to see a fan of the team that lose at home against the champions not give props.

I‚Äôm happy to get responses from people who are hating and truly upset at the pens for losing to the greatest play to ever play. * 2018-07-20T20:36:36+00:00
@mattz40207810 @B_Murchie4 @NHL @ovi8 @ESPYS I mean I wasn't hiding it. Just saying in recent years it could have easily been up for conversation with their repeat and those guys playing like absolute monsters. Not here to detract from one of the most amazing seasons ever from Ovi. Just saying more hockey players need this. * 2018-07-20T03:55:30+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 @ESPYS @NHL the @Canucks have good players but goaltending is a big issue I feel they should bring up demko he will be a leader for the younger guys.

@poem_that @Capitals @ovi8 @NHL @ESPYS @espn Not be rude, but the whole show was picking which sport produced the most memorable moments and games and champs, over the last year.

@mikebailey97 @keeperofthecup @Capitals @NHL @HockeyHallFame @ovi8 Absolutely! Everyone has treated The Cup with extreme reverence and has been overly cautious with It while It has been in their care.

Nothing bad has *ever* happened to The Cup until Ovi got a hold of It.

@NHL @ovi8 @ESPYS Seems to me ESPN is finally seeing the error of their ways and might be trying to get back on the NHLs good side. Not taking anything away from Ovi, he's an extremely talented player and I have nothing but respect for him, just my two cents. * 2018-07-19T16:27:12+00:00
@PeachOmania @TheCameronRoyal @NHL @DCFan21 @ovi8 @ESPYS Ovechkin is the dirtiest player in the game for one, he hits guys from behind when they aren't even looking. Crosby is a better all around player, scoring, passing, playmaking and leadership. He's the best in the world and has been for the past 10 years. * 2018-07-19T15:08:39+00:00

@BarDown @ovi8 @StanleyCup @Capitals There have been more sordid events, in history, involved with that trophy but Alex has just showed us true joy, it has been fun, even from us neutral fans * 2018-07-09T02:49:30+00:00
@djslessor11 @ovi8 Well said. Especially coming from a Leaf fan. As a Canadiens fan, there is no if about them winning next years cup! * 2018-07-09T01:28:16+00:00
Nice story from @ikhurshudyan re @ovi8's time in Russia w/ the #StanleyCup

(interesting note: Ovechkin -apparently not superstitious?- touched the Cup at the @HockeyHallFame when he was a @Caps rookie. I wonder if over the following years, he wondered whether that was a mistake) https://t.co/meWegX9ZNK * 2018-07-08T21:33:36+00:00
Here is a new rule we all can agree on:
Every year every person from the winning team gets the #StanleyCup for a day + no matter who the winner is @ovi8 still gets it for a month each summer. I luv watching this guy and I‚Äôm super happy for him. #ALLCAPS #Isles #IslesTwitter #NHL * 2018-07-08T21:30:24+00:00
@keeperofthecup @ovi8 @Capitals @HockeyHallFame @NHL Did you drink from the Cup this time? * 2018-07-08T19:02:32+00:00
@keeperofthecup @ovi8 @Capitals @HockeyHallFame @NHL From Russia with love! Alex is still clued to the Cup! * 2018-07-08T19:00:08+00:00
@keeperofthecup @NHL @ovi8 @Capitals @HockeyHallFame Is he the only guy from the team who is allowed to touch the cup, enough already no one gives a f@#$ anymore personally  I think he's selfish and stingy with it. * 2018-07-08T17:44:35+00:00
Here‚Äôs another clip from later at Red Square.  The crowd around @ovi8 has grown. @ikhurshudyan is in prime position, though. https://t.co/7mfvrvEilU * 2018-07-08T16:38:13+00:00

@2MinsForHockey @keeperofthecup @ovi8 @Capitals @HockeyHallFame @NHL I have been joking about @keeperofthecup trying to get it away from him since he fist got a hold of it. It is great to see the look of pure joy on his face when he has it * 2018-07-08T14:27:13+00:00
@keeperofthecup @ovi8 @Capitals @HockeyHallFame @NHL Is he wearing the All Star Game hat from when the #LaKings hosted it in 2017? That's random * 2018-07-08T14:20:42+00:00
@TrueBlueTess @Capitals @ovi8 Ovi winning the #StanleyCup is a victory for Russia. The #Caps have many players from all over the world and a handful of Americans. Each player gets their day with the Cup &amp; can take it anywhere they want. Btw first player took to... the USA! Get with it! * 2018-07-08T12:06:22+00:00
@Capitals @ovi8 @StanleyCup Ovi and the Stanley cup  go together like Peanut Butter and jelly. It's what sure be and that come from a fan of 34 years:) * 2018-07-08T07:36:24+00:00

In this #WorldCup, #Russia clearly have (has) the mojo from @ovi8. It‚Äôs not even a question. They‚Äôre riding it and the home-ice advantage. * 2018-07-07T18:37:57+00:00
@BarDown @TSN_Sports @ovi8 After summer, I think Ovie is going to spend the rest of the season holding the cup at the HHOF. Who's gonna be able to take it from him ? * 2018-07-07T15:29:40+00:00
@TomGulittiNHL @ovi8 Glad they learned from the kettler experience that you can't let Ppl take 30 seconds to set in a 5,000 person line. * 2018-07-07T11:57:13+00:00

@Gillette @ovi8 Overpriced! Until the arrival of companies like Harry‚Äôs, using Gillette blades cost a fortune. Face it, Gillette is only offering lower priced blades because of the competition. But why buy from the company that had your business, but abused you. * 2018-06-24T12:18:06+00:00

@BobAndHisDog @RaezillaHockey @TJOshie77 @ovi8 @backstrom19 @tom_wilso @andreburakovsky @JVranaa Yeah and the ones that are from the States are almost certainly white.

@RaezillaHockey @_paranoid_droid @TJOshie77 @ovi8 @backstrom19 @tom_wilso @andreburakovsky @JVranaa I think a huge problem in hockey is that everyone is from somewhere else so they think "Not my problem, the White House is cool" and fail to see how Trump alone has caused such a trash ripple effect around the world * 2018-06-13T19:18:08+00:00

@lewiskay @ovi8 @Capitals Define "not allowing". Other players are grown men and his friends. You imagine them begging Ovi to let them touch the Cup and him refusing? Like, what situation you're thinking about? I doubt anyone on this team wants to bench press the Cup for 5 hours straight, apart from Ovi. * 2018-06-13T17:27:17+00:00

But, the shear joy and 4 day long celebratory drinking bing is both impressive and fun to watch!

@ovi8 and @TJOshie77 have gone from hated rivals to guys I‚Äôd like to party with.  

Congratulations * 2018-06-12T18:07:56+00:00
@heynyc @NHLonNBCSports @Capitals @ovi8 I've noticed every major American team sport calls their champion that. Not sure why, aside from American arrogance (but at least in hockey and baseball,  the players are from several different places). * 2018-06-12T18:06:21+00:00
@DeptofDefense @Capitals Few things more impressive than those military flyovers.  On a side note, it may take some military intervention to get that Stanley Cup away from @ovi8 - he seems to have grown quite attached to it.  #KnowYourMil #ALLCAPS * 2018-06-12T18:06:19+00:00

Little anecdote on @ovi8. Back in 2006-2007, I was really depressed at one point and I was feeling alone bc I have autism. One of my friend knew Ovie a bit and Ovie wrote me a lovely autograph on a sheet of paper saying not to give up. 6 years later I graduated from university. * 2018-06-12T13:26:40+00:00

Hey Robert #Mueller. Alex Ovechkin (@ovi8) is from Russia. He colluded with others in Washington to steal competition results from other Americans. Are you going to charge him with something?

You used to bully so many people on the forum.

Tomorrow, @ovi8 will throw out the first pitfch at Nationals Park. A release from the Capitals says all players will be there. At noon - after a night of partying with that trophy they won. Could be epic! * 2018-06-09T01:57:22+00:00

@GenAndJax @Capitals @NHL @ovi8 They were a part of it? I didn't see any of them lifting the Cup. Must have missed it. Take some advice from a fan of a team that took over 4 decades to get here: if you don't win you go home with nothing, and a good record is cold comfort.

@GF4_93 ...and have Ovi execute. Now accepted the pass is coming from backstrom (top passer in NHL) &amp; shot is Ovi8 (top goal scorer) so he executes 80-90% of time. But still no solution IMO. would leave easy scoring chances open. * 2018-06-08T14:19:59+00:00

@NewYorkPuck @KathrynTappen @ovi8 Stick technology plays a HUGE part in Ovi's success, especially his one timer, I bet you Ovi has a different stick for every goalie in the league he uses game day, also different for PP position 1 timer from point or down low * 2018-06-08T11:34:51+00:00

@ColMorrisDavis @ovi8 @PutinRF_Eng Was always weird to see the flood of white hicks from VA and MD riding the Metro to Penn Quarter with their Caps accoutrements.  Hockey culture overall is persistently racist. * 2018-06-08T03:24:37+00:00

Cant believe i supported @Capitals since 1998,more than 20 years, remember great #bondra times, and never felt the taste of victory in stanley cup, but the time is now. Great lead from @ovi8 to the glory, come on guys you can do it! #ALLCAPS #StanleyCup üëèüëè * 2018-06-03T09:42:07+00:00
@ovi8 I had a diehard Pittsburgh fan rooting for you to win tonight... It was pretty cool. Everyone wants you to win, unless they are from Vegas. * 2018-06-03T07:59:25+00:00
@ovi8 I grew up in Maryland, my wife is from Ukraine. We went to a game two years ago and your future wife was seated next to us... "Stunning" is all my wife could say about your future bride. Thanks for all the happy memories thus far. * 2018-06-03T07:55:20+00:00
@ovi8 I am 37. I have been a die hard Capitals fan since 1997. We went to the Cup only to get swept by Detroit in 4 games. I have followed you since you were drafted. I can only afford about one or two games a year as a bartender. I want nothing from you. I want to thank you. TY. * 2018-06-03T07:52:20+00:00
@ovi8 pumped about coming from Vancouver to watch the game in DC on Monday with my son! Been waiting so long to see you in a cup final game! Hoping you will sign our jerseys at the morning skate!? * 2018-06-03T06:04:37+00:00
@NHLGIFs @ovi8 Its pretty obvious from these that he doesn‚Äôt care about winning * 2018-06-03T03:39:21+00:00

üö® We‚Äôve made it in Sin City! Check out this article from the Las Vegas Advisor, which explains ‚Äúone of the reasons @ovi8 might have had an off game was that he didn‚Äôt enjoy his Mamma Lucia Chicken Parm‚Äù

@NHLPlayerSafety @nhl Do the rules apply or not?  VGK forward David Perron jumped onto the ice from the bench and got into an altercation with @ovi8,  Was he violating rule 70.10. * 2018-05-29T18:07:52+00:00
@ElliceK33 @tom_wilso I agree that hit from @tom_wilso  was late.  but if your going to huddle up and call it - then you also have to call the crosscheck to @ovi8 back later in the third WAYYYYYYY away from the play.  Call it tight or loose - but call it fair.  @nhl * 2018-05-29T16:53:29+00:00
@NBCSCapitals @NHL wants the VGK to sweep./  just look at the no-calls last night!  Icing that is waived off for no apparent reason turns into a goal.   Cross check turns into a goal.  Cross check on @ovi8 away from the play - no call  (PP may have tied the game back up at that point) * 2018-05-29T16:46:11+00:00

I've liked the @Capitals since before Al Iafrate shot the puck 108 mph &amp; I really want @ovi8 to win the #StanleyCup , but to go from no roster to one filled with league "rejects" &amp; to the finals in 11 months is amazing.

Someone just said that andro8 (@ovi8) from the @Capitals "might be the best goal scorer in history".  I almost threw up in my mouth a little.

Interesting quote from @ovi8 on Game 7 officiating.  

Side note: Paul Devorski was a referee for that game 7 in 2008. He's the series officiating supervisor for #WSHvsTBL https://t.co/r7Mxo1dAgP * 2018-05-23T19:23:35+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 @GoldenKnights @91Tavares @drosennhl The Golden Knights success came from coaching but also a more favorable draft. Every NHL team had to leave 4 more players unprotected than the last expansion draft. So they got way better players at every position. * 2018-05-23T19:07:49+00:00

@ovi8 here in California...  Was your fun since you came to NHL  in 2004. Switched from Rangers to Capitals because of you (lived in NYC 25 years). Originally from Piter.   It all on you now, Alex.

Also can we also stop pretending @ovi8 isn‚Äôt a horrendously dirty player? Intentional trip on Stamkos and then just slashing the stick from the goalie‚Äôs hand? Be a professional, man. It‚Äôs ridiculous @NHL doesn‚Äôt penalize such behavior just because it‚Äôs the playoffs. * 2018-05-20T00:38:27+00:00
For those confused by my support of @Capitals - it's simple: @TJOshie77 is from Washington, and I think @ovi8 deserves to try to win the cup. I will bawl like a baby if he hoists that thing with that wonderful smile... #fortheloveofthegame #hockeylife * 2018-05-20T00:38:02+00:00

@greecebaII @Watermelooooone @NHL @ovi8 @Capitals You say #1 overall pick. Now it's top 2, next will it be 1st round draft picks. Then cover it with HOF'ers. By that logic that's every team in the league. Every team that won a Stanley cup from 1915-1962 did not have 1 #1 or first round draft pick on the rosters. Lol * 2018-05-16T20:37:34+00:00

@StanFischler Its just @ovi8 ‚Äòs year, arguably the greatest goal scorer of all time. Not having his name on the cup yet has never been from lack of contribution on his part, even in the years of coming up short, they wouldnt have even been in the playoffs without him. * 2018-05-13T16:50:16+00:00
@JosieJosephinel @Laughlin18 @CourtneyNBCS Happy Mother's Day from Virginia!! üå∫ I hope @ovi8 scores a hat trick for you tonight! #ALLCAPS * 2018-05-13T16:42:47+00:00
im guessing bc @espn is owned in part by @ABCNetwork they cannot show @NHL highlights from @NBCSports The @SportsCenter top 10 didn't even have @ovi8 laser goal from last night. nobody cares about @mlb for 4 more months. #justice #NHLPlayoffs2018 #DC #ALLCAPS https://t.co/CKqF4M10zb * 2018-05-12T14:06:50+00:00
@j_newhall1 @NHL @ovi8 Each game is its own separate entity. The series is far from over. * 2018-05-12T09:47:16+00:00
@suziemiller63 @NHL @ovi8 Try using all four of your eyes, this goal isn't from his office. * 2018-05-12T09:45:10+00:00
@jayRecher @Akillorn19 @ovi8 One goal at the end of a period with 2 periods to go shouldn‚Äôt be deflating!  I understand it‚Äôs tough but with 2 periods remaining they had plenty of time to recover from it. * 2018-05-12T09:23:45+00:00
@Capitals @ovi8 Loved the part where Wilson gets taken down. Karma's a bitch!!! Good on Chris' payback for Aston-Reese's broken jaw from Tom Goon Wilson!
No respect for dirty players! * 2018-05-12T03:07:45+00:00
@TBLightning @Capitals Do you think anyone from the "Zip Code" 688320 was allowed to buy tickets to tonight's game?  Never mind...They had Bench &amp; Ice passes AND Scored goals tonight. @kempney6, @ovi8 @JayBeagle83

@suziemiller63 @NHL @ovi8 might wanna look again, this wasn't from ovi's spot on the left circle, this was a howitzer from the point * 2018-05-12T02:54:46+00:00
@ovi8 has never been this close. He smells the blood. For the first time, he can taste the Legacy permeating from Lord Stanley... to have his name next to Howe, Richard, Orr, Clarke, Bossy, Gretzky, Messier &amp; the like. Awesome! * 2018-05-12T02:54:16+00:00
2018 the year @ovi8 erased the notion from everybody's mind that he doesn't show up in the playoff.  Well done, I know it was only a perception from some but the heart he leaves on the ice deserved to be acknwoledge * 2018-05-12T01:50:05+00:00
@Jerry_flow21 @ovi8 @Capitals @penguins Yeah aint think they‚Äôd come out like this. But they‚Äôre definitely still riding that üåä from winning that last series vs the Pens. * 2018-05-12T01:33:49+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 That‚Äôs just a typical slap shot from the point what‚Äôs so special about it? * 2018-05-12T01:14:41+00:00

@coverme77 @GlobeKPD @Hodgebone @NHLBruins I believe that they are a better team than they showed. I‚Äôm a Bs fan since the Stan Jonathan era and this is the norm. I‚Äôm glad I recorded the playoffs from 2011üëç.       LFG @ovi8 !!!!!! * 2018-05-09T23:15:18+00:00

1. Evgeny Kuznetsov = Poked puck from Pittsburgh 
2. Dmitry Orlov = Picked loose puck swats it to.
3. Alexander Ovechkin = Picked up puck on Backhand and passes backhand.
4. Evgeny Kuznetsov = Catches stretch pass and burns goalie 5 hole.

#Caps 2, #Pens 1 (OT): Kuznetsov's breakaway goal from @ovi8's feed means, that after six unsuccessful tries post-lockout, the Caps finally made it past the second round of the playoffs. Chiasson, @Letang_58 scored in regulation. (WAS 4-2) * 2018-05-09T00:03:12+00:00
@ovi8 @Capitals great win boys!! Take this thing to game 6 vs tampa, all Ive ever wanted for my birthday my whole life (since I was 7üòÇ) is to watch a caps game!! May 21st, take it there.

@TheStJames_ @Capitals @ovi8 It's huge for kids whose parents have tons of disposable income. I would love for my son to skate at @TheStJames_, which is convenient to our home, but, from what I've seen, the cost far exceeds costs at other hockey options in the area. * 2018-05-08T18:05:10+00:00

Shouldn't there be more chatter about this poke-check by @Kuzya92 on Crosby that sets up the entire goal.  Great play, then turns around and springs himself free for the pass from @ovi8. 7 seconds after this play the game is over.  #ALLCAPS https://t.co/yKGDuXvDxG * 2018-05-08T12:47:56+00:00

@NHLonNBCSports @ovi8 @Capitals Emotionally, this was their finals. This just proves it. These types of reactions are typically from the championship winner, not a team half way there. They're in tough against Tampa. * 2018-05-08T09:15:24+00:00

@ovi8 From someone who lives in Pittsburgh thank you so much for shutting them up finally!!! Life long fan here who has endured so much crap from these people here. Now I can proudly walk around * 2018-05-08T02:53:06+00:00
Congrats to the @Capitals . Just re-watched the OT goal. That last possession‚Äîfrom puck drop to goal, I don‚Äôt think any other player on the Caps handled the puck except #EvgenyKuznetsov and @ovi8 . #allcaps @NHL #PensvsCaps #StanleyCupPlayoffs * 2018-05-08T02:48:19+00:00

I love that @ovi8 won this series not with his trademark blast from the left circle, but by winning the puck in his own zone and making a perfect pass to create the play. #StanleyCup * 2018-05-08T02:30:18+00:00

@USNavyMama @WaltonCaps @Capitals Saw my first game in high school. A friend invited me to go with her family. We say two rows away from the glass goal side. That first there into the glass where I saw blood flying from the fight, had me forever hooked!!! Rod Langway quickly became my favorite then came @ovi8 !! * 2018-05-07T23:51:56+00:00
@Capitals @ovi8  so really what it comes down to ...stop Crosby from having a huge game ..Malkin more of the same ...deny the middle and have the goalie play the short side tight * 2018-05-07T22:47:27+00:00
the @Capitals and  @ovi8  knows the Penguins shoot well enough from the circles they have to be honored ...but only 3 or 4 players ...Kessel wants it in the slot and you been winning that .....if they cant shoot from outside the shoot to the middle and tip * 2018-05-07T22:45:54+00:00
Is this finally @ovi8 ‚Äòs year? Ovie has been just 1 win away from the Conference Final 6 times before. The @Capitals are 0-6 in those games.

@NHLonNBCSports @ovi8 @Capitals @NBCSWashington @NBCSCapitals This is literally unreadable. It‚Äôs a four way tie. You seem to have forgotten someone from Winnipeg. * 2018-05-03T21:24:24+00:00
@KushyKandy95 @ovi8 gotcha. I agree. 1 game would work.

@JasonChadwell76 @WhoIsAdamM @Joshadamfeldman @PR_NHL @Capitals @ovi8 @NHLPlayerSafety It‚Äôs not a secret Wilson is a giant dude. He thought he could win a battle and lost. It resulted in an injury and that‚Äôs unfortunate. If I were you I‚Äôd be more pissed about the hit from game 2!!! Even if Wilson didn‚Äôt have time to react that was actually a hit to the head. * 2018-05-02T20:32:36+00:00

@jaasper123 @turk_kevin @NHL @ovi8 @Capitals @NHLPlayerSafety Exactly. And Letang tripping and hitting heads from behind, Hornqvist slashing and holding, they overlook all that. And of course, they blame the refs. Typical Pittsburgh fans, they do the same with football. * 2018-05-02T14:21:29+00:00

@NHL @ovi8 You got two head hits from one guy and a slew foot.  Nice job nhl * 2018-05-02T13:45:01+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 Nice slewfoot from Wilson starts the play off. * 2018-05-02T13:42:15+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 Slew foot aside: bad turnover in the zone, bad read on the break out, Letang going down too early, bad push off from Murray on the cross pass, bad effort all around. * 2018-05-02T13:40:58+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 Captures the trip from Wilson too. Garbage league. * 2018-05-02T13:40:55+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 Great slew foot from Wilson to set up that play. Truly incredible. * 2018-05-02T13:37:10+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 No mention of Tom Wilson needing to be suspended for two head hits in a row, the one from last night causing a broken jaw and concussion? Yeah, @NHLPlayerSafety...way to grow your league from a financial‚Äîor any‚Äîconcept. #WhatAJoke * 2018-05-02T13:36:56+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 So NHL with the second player now out from a questionable and this case intentional hit (jumped up and into, lead with elbow or upper arm) what are I going to do?  Or are u just the WWE on ice * 2018-05-02T13:27:29+00:00

@NHL @ovi8 @Capitals @GatoradeCanada Might be helpful for you to determine where the shoulder is. Note the chin would be near the jaw area. The head would the area where concussions occur. Used this as reference from elementary school if you need it. https://t.co/iTibDZD61b * 2018-05-02T04:23:04+00:00

@Jaketoppen2 @NHL @ovi8 Dude, we had a player who has to have emergency surgery because of a broken jaw and a serious concussion from a dirty hit, yet still nothing will be done. This guy is playing in the same leauge your players are too. It's getting bad man, we aren't crying, this is messed up. * 2018-05-02T03:21:56+00:00
@TheRealEdotB @NHL @ovi8 well look at that jump in the hit.. it can't get more obvious than that, but nope.. not a penalty... the league is already a joke and we should just pull off all refs from play and play as we play on the street.  at least there is no more bias. * 2018-05-02T03:20:34+00:00
@DagueConnor @NHL @ovi8 I know and that should be a penalty and refs just wanna give the game to caps.  But maata can make a safer pass from the blue line though. * 2018-05-02T03:12:15+00:00

@jamienye point of correction, from a Canadian perspective, Crosby may be d best player not necessarily a unanimous perspective.

Looks like the @Capitals are going to rescue themselves from an abyss.

@ovi8 has scored early in the third period to give the Caps a 3-0 lead against the @BlueJacketsNHL.

A very telling graphic from @NBCSN about the @Capitals' @ovi8.

He's the all-time leader in regular season overtime goals with 22, but he has no overtime goals in 99 playoff games.

The second overtime period with the @BlueJacketsNHL has just started.

Yo... @JohnWall @RealDealBeal23 @J_No24 @Real_JordanReed @ovi8 @backstrom19 @Bharper3407 @Max_Scherzer @Anthonyrendon_6 

Serious question, from the heart...

Do you all really care?

 Do you and you're teammates really try to give it your all during big games?  All I'm asking * 2018-04-16T03:26:06+00:00
@ovi8 has to be like @KingJames &amp; take control of Caps or leave for greener pastures. @NHL is diff from pitiful @NBA , but his legendary talent is rotting in @Capitals without a cup. Do u wana retire as best scorer w/o a cup?? * 2018-04-16T03:15:44+00:00
how about a üé©üé©üé© from @Ovi8 for a #Powerplaygoal??? * 2018-04-16T01:23:48+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 It's like he's never scored from there....yea I wouldn't worry about him on that side either * 2018-04-16T01:07:05+00:00
Um... woo!!! @ovi8 with a beautiful pass from @backstrom19  #allcaps #GOCAPS #caps * 2018-04-16T00:59:54+00:00
He has two power play goals tonight.

@ovi8 on a one-timer from just above the bottom of the left circle.

It's 3-1 @Capitals early in the second period.

The @BlueJacketsNHL haven't played poorly, but they're having a hard time keeping up at the moment.

It wasn't a one-timer, but it was still a powerful wrister from the top of the left circle.

Six minutes left in the first period.  The @Capitals lead the @BlueJacketsNHL 2-0.  The Caps almost have to win tonight.

@jorge_laraque @NHL @ovi8 I have. Ovi is stronger, faster, has a harder shot, is more athletic and has learned from watching players like Gretzky. Skills evolve progressively.

With his next goal, @ovi8 will be 300 goal away from Wayne Gretzky goal record (894). At 32 years old, Ovechkin need to average 37G/season for the next 8years.

@BIGDUB_ @DillonSchmidt @kensneade @NHL @ovi8 Exactly. Absolutely Ovechkin is great. They‚Äôve had some downright terrifying teams. But there has to be a sense of unity and I‚Äôve never seen that from the Caps. * 2018-02-20T15:10:58+00:00
@ovi8 next goal will put him 300 goal away from @WayneGretzky all-time goal record (894). If Ovechkin plays until 40years old he need to average 37G/years for the next 8 season. Can he make it and pass the Great one? @Capitals

The Shot Process

Me: 
1-Find a chart of Ovi's powerplay shot attempts from 16-17
2-Set a camera high above the ice based on the data given...cross fingers
3-Get a shot

@ovi8:
1-See puck
2-Blast puck
3-And when all goes according to plan...Celly

@Johnoglethorpe1 @ianoland @DanCriswell @ovi8 Tom Wilson actually produces though. Its also necessary after literally years of Tom Wilson complaints from Pens fans. Now you have someone taking cheap shots and all of a sudden you‚Äôre okay with it ü§îü§îü§î * 2018-02-03T17:28:55+00:00
@IanEsplen @Capitals @ovi8 Very slim chance he achieves that, but the fact he has scored on that clip in today's NHL is insane. Years from now people will look back and realize how under appreciated he was. #great8 * 2018-02-03T07:04:15+00:00

@NHL @ovi8 Still nothing like old school sticks and amazing players. Go AL go! 108 mph with"shit" sticks compared to the state of the art now.

@m_moyers8 @jootyjorts @MightBeCam @NHLPA @ovi8 @Capitals I‚Äôll give Ovi credit where he deserves it. But the way he plays, being so selfish, is why he won‚Äôt win a cup.

@JimmyP776 @redwoodwoof @Laughlin18 @AGMoore1 @ovi8 @PhilippGrubauer The first period was hard to listen to on Caps Radio.  The Capitals have a very difficult time ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù from the week off staggered break. The NHL Owners @TedLeonsis need to consider a revised plan. MLB Baseball Break (all teams off at the same time) appears to be fairest! * 2018-01-20T14:35:01+00:00

What is Ovechkin going to gripe about now that Russia is banned from 2018 Olympics? The ban is a good move for athlete health. See this excellent piece on doping in sports by NYU colleague, Jason Chung.

@NoVa_Caps Even at "Game Speed" it was clear he intentionally reacted to put his leg over causing knee on knee contact with and tripping @Ovi8. Dangerous, bad hit. I hope it gets reviewed by Player Safety. Hit like that is unsafe and needs to be eliminated from the game. * 2017-12-07T11:50:41+00:00

What are the chances @ovi8 ends up with the @GoldenKnights ??? I think very high. Could pair Ovi with Shipachyov from the KHL... * 2017-05-11T15:13:39+00:00
@granthpaulsen @ovi8 not at all but at least it's coming from a @caps fan. Just something to think about. * 2017-05-11T14:56:07+00:00

If I were @ovi8 I would either demand a Trade from @Capitals or just leave to play in Russia now

This playoff trend is pathetic!

@DrCoolSexy @DestoPJ @PR_NHL @ovi8 Thats weird I assumed you were a Pens fan. I expect more class and basic hockey logic from Leafs fans * 2017-05-07T16:47:40+00:00
@DrCoolSexy @PR_NHL @ovi8 Thats from what? 2011? Get real. Wanna look at the goal he scored last night? Pretty much willed it into the net * 2017-05-07T16:47:08+00:00
@ArcheeWasHere @Capitals @ovi8 I expect more from Leafs fans. You should know that hockey is a team sport and that Ovechkin is not the reason for the Caps not winning * 2017-05-07T14:44:56+00:00

Watch it in slo-mo. Slash from @ovi8 &amp; stick bounces off Crosby's head 1st. Split second later, the cross-check from Niskanen. Brutal. https://t.co/hW2gWB4HJv * 2017-05-02T03:02:58+00:00
@NHLPlayerSafety @ovi8 @RealKyper agree the slash from @ovi8 was brutal. Goes with the cross check in front of net and slew foot late in the third. #ovihattrick * 2017-05-02T02:34:56+00:00
Just saw the hit. Nasty stick work from @ovi8. * 2017-05-02T02:33:27+00:00
@Capitals figured out only way @ovi8 will ever contend for a Stanley Cup is to eliminate "Sidney Crosby" from the game. #SidIsBetterthanOvi * 2017-05-02T00:24:05+00:00

Finally @ovi8 from his office * 2017-04-28T01:13:34+00:00
@TheRealJMizzle @WaltonCaps @DIRECTV @ovi8 I always view it as "preparing me" so I snap up from Twitter to view the play * 2017-04-27T23:05:57+00:00
Damn @RusevBUL don't like @Capitals üò≥ @ovi8 is from  üá∑üá∫  why Rusev why ? * 2017-04-27T01:45:30+00:00
That @ovi8 shot nearly crept in but @f_andersen30 did just about enough to keep it from crossing the line‚ùå¬†#WSHvsTOR https://t.co/bAZ5XBOVxK * 2017-04-25T22:20:41+00:00
So we don't lose track .. @ovi8 crushed Brandon Carlo from behind last game of the year knocking him out of playoffs #cheapshot killed us * 2017-04-25T19:56:20+00:00
@dereakmesser21 @ovi8 Yeah buddy, every time that gets played that Bass I bought from Maddox.  The price goes up. * 2017-04-25T00:58:12+00:00
@doraned66 @mirtle @EdmontonOilers @ovi8 Sorry that's a foolish comment. When a player hits low like that nothing good can come from it. Dirty hit from a dirty player. End of story * 2017-04-22T22:45:46+00:00
@andye_andrew @KF_Kadri43 He's a marked man from here on out. Caps have to stay disciplined, but he better watch his back. @43_Kadri @ovi8 * 2017-04-22T12:17:31+00:00
@TSN1050Radio Why do you continue to let Mr. Waters on the air?   Oh and did @ovi8 steal money from him? * 2017-04-22T02:46:42+00:00
Caps win but pretty sure @ovi8 and his left leg are taking a maintenance day tomorrow, Kadri should be getting a call from league then too * 2017-04-22T02:14:42+00:00
@brandonnagy @77coachfan We'll have to agree to disagree on that but clearly @ovi8 agrees with you guys from his post whistle reaction/my lip reading * 2017-04-22T01:05:20+00:00
@sbarbara He learned acting from @ovi8 in the first period. * 2017-04-22T00:52:15+00:00

Bad hit that from Kadri! Hope the injury to @ovi8 isn't too bad! * 2017-04-22T00:05:19+00:00
The Russian Machine has never been broken, but if that knee isn't torn apart from that illegal hit, @ovi8 really is a machine! I'm hoping! * 2017-04-22T00:00:07+00:00

Unfortunately this doesn't look like one @ovi8 just gets back up from. No weight on his leg. Please prove me wrong. @Capitals * 2017-04-21T23:49:26+00:00
And in 2008, 2 goals from @ovi8 helped #Capitals rally from early deficit, beating #Flyers 4-2 &amp; forcing a deciding ECQF Game 7 back in DC. * 2017-04-21T15:58:33+00:00

Between @TJOshie77's first period goal and @ovi8 scoring twice from his office on the power play, @Capitals look frantic to get the 1 seed. * 2017-03-29T01:33:16+00:00

I'm still watching replays of that @ovi8 goal from yesterday and I am still astonished at the velocity that puck had on the way to the net. * 2015-05-03T21:46:15+00:00

@gallaghered @JoshYohe_Trib No, that was the sound of @ovi8 cracking his stick over Letang's legs from behind. * 2015-02-18T03:53:49+00:00
@NHLPlayerSafety @nhl So will @ovi8 get a call from the league? Of course not.  Player discipline is a joke * 2015-02-18T03:40:11+00:00
@ovi8 Another gutless play.  2 hand slash from behind to back of legs. Refused to respond when challenged by Kunitz.  #gutlesspuke * 2015-02-18T03:38:03+00:00
I would take that as an acknowledgement that it was dirty @ovi8.. use the excuse of light-handedness from a lack of championship-ring * 2015-02-18T03:12:21+00:00
@ovi8 will forever be a drunk clown that the NHL refuses to discipline-glad we're showing the young players to take two handers from behind * 2015-02-18T02:49:08+00:00
What. A. Game. #Penguins #Capitals and par for the course with a cheap shot from @ovi8 * 2015-02-18T02:30:28+00:00
I hope somebody pulls "the boss" Rhea move from Goon on @ovi8. So glad @Letang_58 is back. * 2015-02-18T02:11:30+00:00
Typical cheap dirty crap from @ovi8. No penalty for swinging stick like a bat at players ankles is outrageous. Glad @Letang_58 okay. * 2015-02-18T02:10:51+00:00

@drosennhl WOW @ovi8  was right! #NHLrefs still won't call ANYTHING on @NYRangers Bettman's plan is recoupe from lockout w/ extra games! * 2013-05-22T01:46:18+00:00
@HayesTSN I think the "European" stereotype gets lost when you hoist a cup. Pretty sure it would drop from a lot of players that way #Ovi8 * 2013-05-21T23:59:06+00:00

In spite of Crosby's hatty, I respect @ovi8's game and won't hate. He got his ball on the green from the hazard in one chip. That's skill. * 2013-05-18T03:32:47+00:00
@washcaps send @ovi8 to get some lessons from Crosby. Ovechkin 1 goal in 7 games. Crosby just got a hat trick. Lots to learn from Pens. * 2013-05-18T02:23:29+00:00

@TSNBobMcKenzie Oates is has a crazy train of thought. Messing with @ovi8 &amp; hamrlik cause of what side they shoot from? #LookAtTheStandings * 2013-03-05T19:09:07+00:00
Looks like someone showed @ovi8 and @ribz9 the tape from @hockeynight - they‚Äôve come alive! * 2013-03-02T22:17:07+00:00
.@ovi8 How do you go from being awesome to complete garbage? Step up your game, you're weighing down my fantasy team. * 2013-03-02T20:34:46+00:00
I wish #tblighting would just score already so I can switch over to #Caps #Jets so I don't miss any cowardice behavior from @ovi8 #gojetsgo * 2013-03-02T20:27:32+00:00

@ovi8 could learn a thing or two from @28CGiroux. He was in a slump, but dug deep to wake up. As captain, you are expected to show up/lead * 2013-03-01T11:43:20+00:00
Should the #Caps strip Alexander Ovechkin from being captain? VIA @ovi8 - http://t.co/Ej8ycWsOUF * 2013-02-28T20:09:19+00:00

Oh and I love that the guy who hit Danny Briere from behind through an open bench door (@ovi8) is preaching about Harry Z having no respect. * 2013-02-28T05:47:55+00:00
From @eliassports Can @ovi8  become only the 4th visiting player to score in 6 straight games at Philly? #CapitalsTalk * 2013-02-28T00:18:25+00:00

@ovi8 Why don't you play Center? Was that talked about when you moved from LW? I would think with your speed that would be a good fit. * 2013-02-08T23:13:32+00:00

@ovi8 did your dirty coach teach you to hit like that? Good luck being a joke ten years from now w/o a cup. #NYR http://t.co/HTh0uuK1 * 2012-05-06T22:22:44+00:00
Only 3 things separate @ovi8 hit on #Girardi From #Torres It wasnt late, he left his feet prior to contact, and #Girardi wasnt injured #NHL * 2012-05-06T11:06:10+00:00
I can't wait for the lack of explanation from @NHLShanahan on why he doesn't suspend @ovi8 for his flying head shot on #Girardi #HNIC * 2012-05-06T10:59:08+00:00
I can't wait for the lack of explanation from @NHLShanahan on why he doesn't suspend @ovi8 for his flying head shot on #Girardi #TSN * 2012-05-06T10:58:52+00:00
Ugh that was ugly @ovi8 ... hopefully no penalties from the league * 2012-05-05T17:48:41+00:00

@MitchellxShaw i couldn't really ask for more than a kiss and a point to the heavens from @ovi8 * 2012-05-01T14:22:15+00:00
@wldthing20 @ngreenberg @ovi8 but you have to admit he takes a lot more slack and public scorning from DH than Wideman for example * 2012-05-01T12:50:40+00:00
Prediction: Hunter gets canned from Caps coaching job early next season for lack of @ovi8 . Fans come to see OV for more than 13 mins a game * 2012-05-01T07:45:17+00:00
@ovi8's goal tonight was a snipe like we used to see from Ovechkin. I miss those days. * 2012-05-01T04:03:41+00:00

@10_AMac @ovi8 he's suspended, right? for ex. when you're suspended from school, you're not allowed at ANY, even extracurricular, functions. * 2012-01-26T18:28:00+00:00
Why are you skipping the All Star Weekend, @ovi8? Everyone knows the resolution for instagram won't be nearly as good from behind the TV. * 2012-01-26T16:59:32+00:00

@EyeOnHockey @10_AMac @ovi8 Not so much "classeless", as selfish, & expected from him. Hockey made him, he doesn't care & won't give back. * 2012-01-25T16:48:15+00:00
Ditch @NHL All-Star Weekend if there isn't equal commitment from the stars, league, @NHLPA Fans pay the salaries. Bad PR when @ovi8 no-show * 2012-01-25T16:06:48+00:00

@ovi8 used to be a huge advocate of yours, and like MANY others that couldn't be further from the truth now. * 2012-01-24T18:23:30+00:00
@ovi8 From a fans perspective, I think you're unique and exciting, I no longer do. You're a tool for not attending the allstar game. selfish * 2012-01-24T18:21:07+00:00
@ovi8 withdraws from all star game hopefully @jneal_18 gets in now #deaervesitmoreanyways * 2012-01-24T18:14:35+00:00

If @ovi8 is suspended for 3 games from @NHL by @NHLShanahan , does that mean he misses the nhl all star game? * 2012-01-24T00:52:19+00:00
@ovi8 - I'm really hoping you still participate in the all-star game, you earned it.  Don't let the NHL take that away from you & the fans. * 2012-01-24T00:16:01+00:00
@NHL @ovi8 @NHLShanahan 3 games was well deserved and a clear message from nhl to Ovie. Well done. * 2012-01-24T00:04:09+00:00
@ovi8 Skip the ASG. There's no reason the @nhl should get to benefit from you being there. * 2012-01-23T23:54:03+00:00
@CapitalsInsider if @ovi8 gets 3 for that hit, I think they should take another look at the hit from behind on Hendricks! That was way worse * 2012-01-23T23:40:59+00:00
Just like I said earlier, @ovi8 hit no different from Engelland hit. Engo got 3 games, so it's fair that Alex got 3 games. * 2012-01-23T23:34:33+00:00
Anyone out there who thinks @ovi8 shouldn't be suspended, how is his hit all that different from the hit that cost Deryk Engelland 3 games? * 2012-01-23T22:37:23+00:00
