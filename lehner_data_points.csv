Any other subject or topic get this public attacks there would be some backing from your employers. Something from the league that it isn‚Äôt ok to discriminate. Not one word of support or action.

2021-12-18 17:48:44-05:00	Has @nhl done anything to condemn  this or the nhlpa? I retweeted a few days ago a small taste of what‚Äôs there for me on social media. I‚Äôm not gonna stop using social media as it still helps people that deals with what I deal with. I suggest nhl stops advocating for mental health
2021-12-18 17:48:44-05:00	I have to deal with on social media from fans across the league and trough my career. Media outlets and papers that have stigmatized everything around my condition.  not just people in their moms basement. No one has a clue what‚Äôs in my dm or what I‚Äôm always tagged in.
2021-12-18 17:48:43-05:00	Being open about my bipolar was a choice to help others. To help people that struggles with mental illness to see it‚Äôs possible to be accepted.People call me sensitive and that I want attention.I wanted attention to the subject of mental health. No one have any idea of the stuff
